#
# v0.26.0 (was v0.25.1, sha256:e4f88a83...). Upgraded 2026-08-17 to diagnose an
# EngineCore that dies mid-serving with NO traceback, NO CUDA error and no OOM
# kill (node-wide /proc/vmstat oom_kill stayed 0 across nine deaths). v0.26.0
# adds "log worker exit code when a process dies unexpectedly" (#38641), which
# names the fatal signal instead of leaving us to infer it. Also carries a
# DSv3.2 + MTP sequence-parallel accuracy fix; this deployment runs MTP.
#
# Declared as an ARG, not inlined into FROM, so this line is the SINGLE place
# the base digest lives. CI's post-build cleanup greps it out of this file to
# decide which vllm/vllm-openai layer sets are superseded and safe to evict
# (vllm-warden#208). Inlining it would let the Dockerfile and the cleanup drift,
# and a cleanup that reads a stale digest deletes the base you are still using.

# llama.cpp build, pinned. Sub-project C, decision D2: llama-server is baked

# WHY WE BUILD RATHER THAN COPY. ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda is
# mainline and prebuilt, and it does not work here: it is built on Ubuntu 24.04
# and needs GLIBC_2.38 / GLIBCXX_3.4.32, while this base is Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc
# 2.35, GLIBCXX_3.4.30). Its `server-cuda` tag is also CUDA 12.8 against this
# image's CUDA 13.0.2, so its libggml-cuda.so wants libcudart.so.12 sonames we
# do not ship; carrying the CUDA 12.8 runtime to satisfy it would add ~2.4 GiB.
# Building in the base image itself makes glibc, libstdc++ and CUDA match by
# construction. Nothing about the source is modified -- spec §2 -- this is
# upstream's own CMake on an upstream tag.
ARG LLAMACPP_BUILD=b10731

# CUDA architectures llama.cpp is compiled for. The default is EVERY
# architecture this image's toolchain can target. Not asserted -- measured:
# `nvcc --list-gpu-arch` inside vllm/vllm-openai@${VW_BASE_DIGEST} (CUDA 13.0,
# V13.0.88) answers exactly
#   compute_75 80 86 87 88 89 90 100 103 110 120 121
# and that list is the hard ceiling. CUDA 13 dropped Maxwell, Pascal and
# Volta, so 75 (Turing) is the floor and there is nothing below it to add.
#
# This was "75-real;86-real" until 2026-09-06 -- exactly the two cards on the
# machine it was developed on (Quadro RTX 5000, RTX A4000). That is a fine
# choice for a LOCAL build and the wrong one for a PUBLISHED image: -real emits
# native SASS and nothing else, so on an Ada (RTX 40xx, L4, L40S), Hopper
# (H100) or Blackwell (RTX 50xx, B200) card the llama.cpp backend did not run
# slowly, it was ABSENT -- the product's second engine simply missing on
# hardware it should be good at. The published image has to work wherever the
# toolchain allows; narrowing is the local builder's call, so it is an ARG:
#
#   docker compose build --build-arg LLAMACPP_CUDA_ARCHS="86-real" api
#
# That is not a rounding error. Measured on 32 threads, this one step: 158 s
# for "86-real", 240 s for the old "75-real;86-real", 1069 s for the default
# below. The cost is linear -- about 77 s of fixed C++/link work plus ~81 s per
# architecture -- so anyone compiling for one known card should pass the arg and
# come out FASTER than the old two-card default. README.md and
# documents/INSTALL.md carry the full table and the 4-core figures.
#
# THE -virtual ENTRY IS NOT DECORATION. -real is native SASS for one
# architecture; -virtual embeds PTX, which the driver JIT-compiles for any
# newer one. It is the difference between "a card nobody here has heard of is
# slow for a few seconds on first load" and "a card nobody here has heard of
# does not work at all". Without it, the day NVIDIA ships compute capability
# 13, this backend is gone on it and the fix is a rebuild.
#
# It is 90-virtual and NOT 121-virtual -- the numerically highest -- and that
# was settled by running cmake, not by reading the number:
#   * ggml/src/ggml-cuda/CMakeLists.txt rewrites any plain 12X to 12Xa
#     (observed: "Replacing 121-virtual in CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES with
#     121a-virtual") because Blackwell's FP4 tensor-core instructions are not
#     forwards compatible. An -a PTX blob JITs for that one architecture and
#     nothing else, so 121-virtual would buy zero future coverage while looking
#     like it bought all of it.
#   * compute capability stopped being a linear feature ladder at Blackwell --
#     sm_120 is consumer Blackwell and does not have sm_100's tcgen05 -- so PTX
#     emitted above 9.0 is not a safe universal JIT source either.
# 90 is the highest architecture-generic PTX the toolchain still offers, and is
# the same fallback upstream llama.cpp ships in its own default list. Nothing
# at or below 121 needs it -- all of that is covered by -real above -- so the
# PTX only ever has to serve hardware that does not exist yet, which is
# precisely the case where "generic" beats "newest".
#
# 87, 88 and 110 are Jetson/Thor SoC parts that cannot appear under this
# x86_64-only image, and they are kept anyway with the cost stated so the next
# person can drop them knowingly: about 4 minutes of the compile on 32 threads
# and ~50 MB. The rule "everything nvcc accepts" is one a base-image bump
# maintains for free; a hand-curated list of what we think exists is one that
# silently rots, which is how this ARG came to say "75;86" in the first place.
#
# 120 and 121 are written plain and become 120a/121a through the rewrite above
# -- deliberately; that is upstream's FP4 policy, and writing them plain keeps
# us on that policy if upstream changes it.

# HOW WIDE the compile runs is a different question from how many architectures
# it emits, and widening the list above is what stopped `nproc` being a safe
# answer to it. Every .cu is now 13 device compilations instead of 2, so each
# -j lane holds a cicc/cudafe++/ptxas child roughly 6.5x longer: where the
# two-architecture build's lanes were briefly heavy and then idle, all of them
# are heavy essentially all of the time. Core count alone stopped describing
# the peak, so -j has to answer to memory as well.
#
# Not a hypothesis -- this is the kernel's own OOM report from the first CI run
# that ever attempted the full list (job 244537, 14% in). On a 12-core, 3.7 GiB
# shared runner `-j$(nproc)` put 12 nvcc lanes in flight whose children held
# 1921 MB resident plus 797 MB swapped, and the kernel killed buildkitd rather
# than any compiler, taking the whole build down with it. Largest single lane:
# one cicc at 514 MB.
#
# Hence one lane per 512 MiB of build memory, capped by nproc. 512 MiB is that
# measured worst lane rounded down, not a guess at a number small enough to be
# safe -- and being a per-lane BUDGET rather than a ceiling it is inert on any
# machine actually built for this work: the memory term does not bind until a
# host has less than 512 MiB per core, so the 16C/32T box the architecture list
# was measured on still gets all 32 lanes as long as it has 16 GiB. Only a host
# that genuinely cannot hold the build is slowed down, and slowed is the point
# -- it used to be killed.
#
# The budget follows a cgroup memory limit when there is one, so capping the
# builder (`docker buildx create --driver-opt memory=...`) narrows -j to match
# instead of fighting it. Override both terms if you know better:

# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH='$ORIGIN:/opt/llamacpp' + BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH: the

#   whose empty trailing element resolves against the CWD, which works only under
#   their WORKDIR /app; our engine is launched by a supervisor from elsewhere.
#
#   BOTH entries, and the second is not redundant. argv[0] is the bare name
#   `llama-server`, which PATH resolves to the SYMLINK /usr/local/bin/llama-server.
#   An exec of that symlink works on $ORIGIN alone -- the kernel sets
#   /proc/self/exe to the real path, so $ORIGIN is /opt/llamacpp -- but `ldd` and
#   `ld.so --list` expand $ORIGIN from the path they are GIVEN, so they report
#   libllama-server-impl.so as "not found" through the symlink while the binary
#   runs perfectly. Depending on that asymmetry is how a subtle loader bug hides;
#   the absolute entry costs nothing, is a path we own, and makes every tool
#   agree with reality.
# GGML_STATIC is deliberately NOT set: it adds a global `-static` link on UNIX,

#   when this step is slow the first question is always "how parallel was it",
