# Architecture

One published port. Caddy fans out to internal-only `api` and `ui` containers:

| Path | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | FastAPI `/_landing` | Public landing page (can be disabled) |
| `/ui/*` | Next.js | Browser UI |
| `/api/*` | FastAPI | JWT-gated control plane |
| `/v1/*` | FastAPI | OpenAI-compatible proxy (token-gated) |
| `/healthz` | FastAPI | Liveness probe |

Routing lives in `deploy/caddy/Caddyfile`. The `api` container shares the host
PID namespace so GPU process attribution can map host PIDs back to
supervisor-tracked engine workers.

Inside the api container, two axes compose rather than multiply:

- a **driver** answers *where* an engine process runs — an in-container
  subprocess (the default) or a sibling container over the Docker socket;
- a **backend** answers *which program runs*, with what argv, env, health probe,
  log grammar and capabilities.

Adding either is O(1), not O(n×m). Both engines speak OpenAI over HTTP and both
serve `/health`, which is why the proxy, the watchdog and the warmup probe
needed no engine-specific code at all. `GET /api/system/backends` reports what
this build has and — separately — what the *active driver* will actually let it
do, so a control that cannot work is disabled with a reason instead of a load
failing forty seconds in.

## Two engines, and the model that made us add the second

There is one product invariant, and everything below follows from it:

> **We ship mainline runtimes. No monkeypatching, ever.**

No patched engine image, no vendored fork, no `sh -c "patch && exec …"`
entrypoint, no `sitecustomize.py`, no `LD_PRELOAD`. A launch is argv plus
environment and nothing else. That is enforced by the type the launch path
speaks — it has no field to put a patch in — and by a test that fails if the
vocabulary reappears.

The invariant is easy to hold right up until a model you want will not load.

**The worked example.** `ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-27B-3Bit-GSQ` quantises the
embedding table. Mainline vLLM's weight loader has no entry for it, so the load
dies with:

```
ValueError: There is no module or parameter named 'embed_tokens.weight_packed'
in Qwen3_5Model
```

The model card's own remedy is a newer vLLM **plus a Python monkeypatch applied
to the interpreter before the server starts**. Under the invariant that is not
"hard", it is forbidden. So on vLLM this model is unsupported, and stays
unsupported until upstream adds the format.

The same authors publish a GGUF conversion, and their model card says it runs
unmodified in llama.cpp. It does. Measured, on one 16 GiB RTX A4000:

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | `ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-GGUF` |
| Weights | `Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-IQ3_XXS.gguf` — 10,094,357,632 B |
| Vision projector | `mmproj-Qwen3.8-27B-BF16.gguf` — 931,146,528 B |
| Context | `--ctx-size 8192`, requested and held |
| Steady-state VRAM | 12,039 MiB of 16,376 MiB |
| CPU offload | none — llama.cpp's own sizing kept every layer on the card |

Coherent multi-turn chat across a deliberate distractor, correct arithmetic,
exact format compliance, and a correct description of an image generated for the
test — through the product's own `/v1/chat/completions`, not against the engine
port.

The claim is narrow: *a model the product genuinely could not serve is served,
unmodified, by a different mainline backend.* One row, one field. It is not
that vLLM is bad. It is that being locked to a single engine does not make the
other models slower — it makes them unavailable.

Three consequences:

- **GGUF quantisation fits larger models onto smaller cards.** A 27B model on
  one 16 GiB card is a 3-bit quant's whole point.
- **Older GPUs stay useful as vLLM's support moves on.** Turing is not on
  vLLM's happy path any more; llama.cpp still serves it.
- **Heterogeneous boxes are ordinary, not exotic.** An Ampere card next to a
  Turing card is what a machine that grew looks like, and the stats page reads
  them as two different cards rather than averaging them into a fiction.

### What the second engine costs

**llama.cpp publishes no latency histograms at all.** vLLM exposes four; the
llama.cpp `/metrics` endpoint has none. The choice was to leave the latency
panels blank for GGUF models, or to measure latency somewhere both engines have
in common — so the panels now come from the **proxy's own** measurements: TTFT
at the first streamed frame, duration at the end of the stream, persisted per
request. GGUF models got a latency panel for the first time because of that gap.
What is given up is the engine's per-token resolution; the stored inter-token
latency is a mean per request and is labelled that way everywhere it appears.

The same rule runs through the rest of the metrics: a number the engine does not
report renders as **"not reported"**, never as `0`. A zero says "plenty of KV
headroom" or "the engine is idle"; the truth is "this engine is silent about
that", and an operator who acts on the first has been actively misled. On
llama.cpp that means KV-cache usage, sleep state, preemptions and MFU are blank
rather than reassuring.

Two more limits worth knowing before you pick it:

- **llama.cpp's version is fixed by the warden image** (`b10731`). Bumping it is
  a warden release, not a per-model choice. vLLM's version can be pinned per
  model, but only under the Docker engine driver — the UI disables the control
  and says which of the two reasons applies rather than offering a switch that
  does nothing.
- **A GGUF-only repository ships no tokenizer**, so token accounting falls back
  to a character estimate (which also drives per-token rate limits). Set
  `tokenizer_repo` to the upstream safetensors sibling and counts are exact,
  local and free. The degradation is reported rather than hidden.

Choosing between them is mostly automatic: pick a `.gguf` file in **Add model**
and the wizard pre-selects llama.cpp. It is a pre-selection, not a rule — a GGUF
that vLLM can also serve stays available to vLLM.
