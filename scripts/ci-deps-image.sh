# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Resolve the prebuilt CI dependency image for the current requirements pair.
#
# WHY. Every Python job in .gitlab-ci.yml used to `pip install -r
# requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt` straight from PyPI: 22-55 s in each
# of four jobs, 130-200 runner-s per pipeline, to reinstall a pinned dependency
# set that changes a couple of times a month. `make test-unit` / `make lint` /
# `make typecheck` paid the same cost on every local run and failed outright
# whenever PyPI was slow (observed twice on 2026-09-03).
#
# The image tag is a sha256 of the two requirements files, so an unchanged pair
# always resolves to the same tag and only a real dependency change misses.
# `build:ci-deps-image` in .gitlab-ci.yml is what builds and pushes it.
#
# GRACEFUL DEGRADATION IS THE WHOLE POINT. When the tag is not available --
# the first pipeline after this landed, a registry outage, a pruned tag, a
# runner with no pull route -- this falls back to exactly the old behaviour:
# the plain base image plus the same `pip install`. A CI change that hard-fails
# on a cold cache is worse than the slow status quo it replaces.
#
# USAGE. Source it (do not execute it) so the exports survive into the caller:
#
#     . ./scripts/ci-deps-image.sh                       # python-only flavour
#     export VW_PY_FLAVOR=pynode; . ./scripts/ci-deps-image.sh
#
# Inputs (all optional):
#     VW_PY_FLAVOR   `py` (default, python:3.11-slim) or `pynode`
#                    (nikolaik/python-nodejs, which conformance:chat2 needs
#                    because it runs the backend and the node conformance
#                    runner on the same loopback interface)
#     VW_DEPS_PULL   attempt a registry pull on a local miss. Implied in CI
#                    ($CI). Off by default on a workstation so a machine with
#                    no route to registry.podwarden.com falls back instantly
#                    instead of blocking on a doomed pull.
#     VW_DEPS_BUILD  build the image locally on a miss (the CI builder job and
#                    `make deps-image`).
#     VW_DEPS_PUSH   push after building. Set by the CI builder job and by
#                    `make deps-image` -- the arm64 tag exists only because a
#                    workstation pushed it, since CI runs on amd64 runners and
#                    does not build arm64. Best-effort: a push failure warns
#                    and leaves the locally built image in place.
#
# Exports:
#     VW_PY_TAG      requirements digest (16 hex chars) plus `-<arch>`, so an
#                    amd64 runner and an arm64 workstation never collide on
#                    one tag
#     VW_ARCH        normalised machine arch: amd64 / arm64 / other
#     VW_DEPS_IMAGE  the prebuilt image ref for this flavour
#     VW_BASE_IMAGE  the plain base image this flavour falls back to
#     VW_RUN_IMAGE   what to `docker run`: VW_DEPS_IMAGE on a hit, VW_BASE_IMAGE
#                    on a miss
#     VW_PIP         what to run inside the container first: `:` (a no-op) on a
#                    hit, the pip install on a miss. Callers pass it in with
#                    `-e VW_PIP` and start their inner script with
#                    `eval "$VW_PIP"`, which keeps the existing single-quoted
#                    job bodies untouched.
#
# NOTE ON `set -e`. This file is sourced into a shell the GitLab runner already
# put in `set -e`, so every command here is either inside an `if` condition or
# `|| true`-guarded, and the file ends on a deliberate status: non-zero only
# when an explicitly requested build/push failed.

# The tag carries the ARCHITECTURE as well as the requirements digest, because
# a digest alone made an Apple-silicon workstation strictly slower than having
# no prebuilt image at all. `make deps-image` pulls before it builds; the CI
# builder runs on amd64 runners, so the registry held an amd64-only tag; and
# `docker pull` on an arm64 Mac happily fetches it and runs it under QEMU.
# The pull therefore SUCCEEDED, `vw_deps_have_image` went true, and the native
# local build never ran -- turning a 3-4 minute emulated mypy into the normal
# case and leaving the operator to conclude the tooling was simply slow.
#
# With the arch in the tag the arm64 pull misses (nothing pushes that tag), so
# the same `make deps-image` falls through to a local build that is native and
# takes about as long as the pip install it replaces, once.
