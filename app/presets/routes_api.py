"""HTTP routes for built-in tuning presets (S4).

Single read-only endpoint: ``GET /api/presets``. Auth-gated like every
other ``/api/*`` route. The response shape is deliberately small —
``{presets: [{id, name, description, target_archetype, settings}]}`` —
because the FE renders the dropdown directly from this payload and
applies the ``settings`` dict via the existing
``PATCH /api/models/{id}/settings`` endpoint.

Presets are not user-editable today; we ship four built-ins and add to
them via a JSON edit + redeploy. If/when operator-owned presets become a
requirement, this module is where the POST/DELETE handlers land — they
will write to a new ``presets`` table without touching this read path.
