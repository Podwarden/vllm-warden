"""Built-in tuning presets for the model settings page (S4).

A preset is a named bundle of PATCHable ModelRow fields that gets applied
in one shot to a model's settings (after operator confirmation) — the FE
calls ``GET /api/presets`` to populate the dropdown, then issues a normal
``PATCH /api/models/{id}/settings`` with the preset's ``settings`` dict
spread into the body. The backend stays dumb about what a preset is for;
preset *application* is a frontend concern.

We ship a small curated set of four presets keyed to common GPU
archetypes that we've seen in the field. Adding more is a 1-line JSON
edit; no schema migration required.

The list is loaded once at import time from ``builtin.json`` next to this
module. Tests can pass an explicit ``presets_path`` to ``load_presets``
for fixture coverage.
