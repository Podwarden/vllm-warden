    """In-memory exclusive GPU ownership: gpu_idx -> model_id.

    LLM Warden runs at most ONE loaded model per GPU. That is a deliberate
    exclusivity rule, not a capacity check -- a conflict is refused here,
    before the engine is ever spawned, so no amount of lowering
    ``gpu_memory_utilization`` will get past it. (It would not help anyway:
    vLLM reserves its KV cache as a fraction of the WHOLE card, so the
    default 0.9 leaves nothing behind however small the weights are.)

    ``label`` carries the operator-facing name of the claiming model so a
    refusal can say WHICH model is in the way. The bare
    ``GPUs [0] already claimed`` that this used to raise named neither the
    occupant nor a remedy, and it surfaces verbatim as the model's
    ``last_error`` in the UI -- so a first-time user reads it as a capacity
    problem and starts tuning numbers that cannot change the outcome.
