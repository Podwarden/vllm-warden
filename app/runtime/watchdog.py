"""Engine watchdog: detect a dead engine under a live wrapper, preserve the
evidence, and restore the model to its pre-crash condition.

Why this exists (2026-08-17). ``RuntimeSupervisor._watch_exit`` awaits
``handle.wait()`` on the process the driver spawned — for the local driver that
is the ``vllm serve`` **wrapper**. vLLM v1 runs ``EngineCore`` and the TP workers
underneath it. Four times in one day EngineCore died while the wrapper stayed
alive, so the wait never returned, ``on_exit`` never fired, the row kept
``status='loaded'`` and the proxy forwarded to a dead engine indefinitely:

    794285  uvicorn (warden api)
    800137  └─ vllm serve          <-- ALIVE, RSS 2.1 GB
    801311     └─ resource_tracker   <-- only child left

The wrapper is also an unreliable signal in the other direction: at 07:39 it did
exit, at 09:03 it was still alive seven minutes later. So this watchdog does not
watch processes at all — it asks the engine's own /health endpoint, which is the
same signal the load path already trusts.

    """True when a row is a crashed engine that WAS serving, so restart it.

    One predicate, deliberately, for both ways a serving engine can end up
    dead: the warden restarted underneath it (boot reconciliation sets
    prior_status), or the engine died while the warden kept running
    (``on_exit`` sets it). Those used to be handled by different mechanisms
    and only the first one worked.

    This reads ``prior_status``, NOT ``last_error``. The old code compared
    last_error against an exact sentence, so any diagnosis written on the
    crash path displaced the sentinel and silently disabled recovery -- the
    2026-08-18 outage, where the model sat dead for 1h43m advertising a
    completely unrelated "requires trust_remote_code" message.

    ``loading`` counts too, and that is safe for a non-obvious reason: the
    ONLY writer of ``prior_status='loading'`` is boot reconciliation, i.e.
    "the warden restarted while this model was mid-load". ``on_exit`` sets
    ``prior_status`` exclusively for rows that were ``loaded``, so a model
    that failed on its own merits during a user-initiated load never gets the
    flag and is never retried here. Bad configs still stay down for a human.

    Without ``loading``, a model interrupted while it was being auto-restarted
    became permanently unrecoverable -- which is exactly how prod stayed dead
    for 11.5 hours on 2026-08-18/19: the engine crashed, the sweep restarted
    it, the respawn stalled in ``loading``, the pod later restarted, and the
    row was then ineligible forever.

    ``pulling`` and ``unloading`` are deliberately excluded: a half-finished
    pull is not a serving model, and an unload is an operator's stated intent.

    ``leases`` is the stress-test registry (``app/stress/lease.py``), optional
    so every existing caller is unaffected. A model under an unexpired stress
    lease is skipped: its run crashed the engine on purpose, is already probing
    far more tightly than this loop's ~90s detection latency, and will restart
    it itself. Without this, the sweep and the runner both call ``_restart``,
    which force-unloads unconditionally, and whichever loses the race destroys
    the other's freshly loaded engine -- while both charge the restart budget
    that leaves the model dead after three.

    The check belongs HERE rather than in ``check_once`` because this predicate
    is what both recovery paths consult. ``check_once`` only ever sees rows
    whose status is ``loaded``, and a crash sets ``failed`` first, so guarding
    it would guard the path that does not fire.
