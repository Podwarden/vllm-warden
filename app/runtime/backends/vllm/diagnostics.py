"""Turn a vLLM engine-log tail into an actionable, operator-facing error.

When a load fails, the control plane historically reported only a generic
``last_error`` ("vllm subprocess exited unexpectedly (rc=1)"). The real cause
is in the engine log (``{data_dir}/logs/{model_id}.log``). This pure parser
scans the tail and, for the failure modes we can recognise, produces a message
that tells the operator exactly what to change.

Matching is on STABLE tokens, not exact phrasing — vLLM's wording drifts across
versions and even contains typos (the real observed string says ``models's``). We key
off invariants and capture numbers opportunistically. No match → ``None`` so
the caller keeps its existing generic message.

The failure modes we distinguish carefully (all observed live):

  0. **The card was already occupied.** vLLM's pre-flight free-memory check
     fires before it profiles anything ("Free memory on device cuda:0
     (1.65/15.6 GiB) on startup is less than desired GPU memory utilization").
     This is the most likely first-run failure on a host that already runs
     something, and it used to fall through every rule here, leaving the
     operator with a bare "vllm subprocess exited unexpectedly (rc=1)".

  1. **KV cache too small for context.** vLLM prints its OWN profiled fit
     estimate ("the estimated maximum model length is N"). That estimate beats
     any static heuristic, so we surface N as ``recommended_max_model_len`` and
     tell the operator to cap to it (or raise gpu_memory_utilization). This is
     the ``tencent/Hy-MT2-1.8B`` footgun.

  2. **No room for the cache blocks at all** ("No available memory for the
     cache blocks", typically with a NEGATIVE "Available KV cache memory"). The
     weights + overhead already exceed the budget; lowering ``max_model_len``
     does NOT help. We must NOT suggest it — only more/larger GPUs or a higher
     gpu_memory_utilization. ``recommended_max_model_len`` stays ``None``.

There is deliberately NO auto-retry here: the post-crash path only REPORTS.
Auto-relaunching on a parsed estimate risks oscillation; the static pre-spawn
preflight (``app/models/load_preflight.py``) is the only place we adjust a
launch, and only for the NULL-max_model_len case.
