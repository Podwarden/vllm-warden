"""The vLLM backend.

Deliberately thin. Everything substantial lives in the three modules beside it
-- ``args`` (argv construction and the #211 bind-host policy), ``env`` (the
subprocess env and its allowlist), ``diagnostics`` (the log grammar) -- which
arrived here by ``git mv`` from ``app/runtime/`` and carry the comments
recording nine production incidents. This module is the adapter that presents
them as a ``Backend``; it holds no logic of its own, so reading a vLLM
behaviour question still lands you in the file that explains it.
