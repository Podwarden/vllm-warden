# per-file GGUF downloads via the ``filename`` column, but the launcher kept
# emitting ``--model <hf_repo>`` only — every GGUF deployment died at vllm
# subprocess startup with rc=1. We recover the quant tag from the filename
# (``...-Q5_K_M.gguf``). The pattern allows extended variants like
# ``UD-Q4_K_XL`` by anchoring on ``-Q`` + a digit + arbitrary
# letters/digits/underscores up to ``.gguf``. When the filename is missing or
# the regex doesn't match we fall back to the bare hf_repo — same behaviour as
# pre-#85, so safetensors / non-quantized rows are unaffected. See issue #100.

    """Interface vLLM binds its HTTP server to, chosen by engine driver.

    The engine's own OpenAI server is COMPLETELY UNAUTHENTICATED: whatever
    can open a TCP connection to it gets ``/v1/chat/completions`` directly,
    behind the back of ``require_bearer`` (app/proxy/auth.py), the per-token
    rate limiter, the priority scheduler and every byte of token accounting.
    So the bind host is a security boundary, not a connectivity knob, and it
    has to be as narrow as the driver allows.

    ``local`` — the in-container subprocess driver, and the default engine
    driver (app/config.py) i.e. what production actually runs (a Kubernetes
    pod). The engine is a child process sharing the warden's own network
    namespace, so the control plane reaches it over loopback
    (``LocalSubprocessDriver.engine_host`` returns ``127.0.0.1``) and
    ``0.0.0.0`` buys nothing except exposure: on the pod IP, ports
    10000-10999 become a free, unmetered LLM API for every other pod in the
    cluster. Loopback it is. This is issue #211; the pre-#211 default was
    ``0.0.0.0`` for every driver, and the docstring here used to call the
    local driver "legacy" and frame loopback as an opt-in, which is exactly
    backwards and is what made the hole look deliberate.

    ``docker`` — the docker-socket driver runs each engine as a SEPARATE
    container with its own netns, so loopback inside that container is not
    addressable from anywhere else. It genuinely needs ``0.0.0.0`` on the
    engine's eth0: neither the api container (which dials the engine by its
    docker DNS name) nor docker-proxy's published port can reach an
    unbound-on-eth0 engine — docker-proxy forwards to the container's eth0,
    gets RST, the supervisor health probe times out and the row flips to
    ``failed`` despite ``Application startup complete.`` in the engine log
    (that was #180). Containment for this driver belongs at the docker
    network / firewall layer, not here.

    Any other driver name resolves to loopback, same as ``local``. That is
    deliberate: a future driver that needs a wider bind fails LOUDLY (health
    probe times out at first load) instead of silently republishing the
    unauthenticated API, so the failure mode of forgetting to update this
    function is an outage, never a breach.

    ``VW_ENGINE_BIND_HOST`` still wins when set, so an operator keeps the
    escape hatch (e.g. binding one specific pod IP) — but it is no longer
    what decides the safe default. An empty value counts as unset: an
    exported-but-blank env var would otherwise produce ``--host ''`` and a
    dead engine. Read per-call so the env is honoured without re-importing
    the module."""
