"""name -> Backend.

The ONE place a backend is registered. Adding a backend is adding a line to
``_BACKENDS``; adding a driver is adding a class under ``app/runtime/engine/``.
Neither multiplies the other, which is the whole point of decision D1.

Name resolution ONLY. Capability questions go to the backend --
``registry.get(name).capabilities`` and ``.version_pin_available(driver)``.
