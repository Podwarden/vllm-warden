"""The Backend axis: which program serves a model, and how we talk to it.

A **driver** (``app/runtime/engine/``) answers *where a process runs* — an
in-container subprocess, a sibling container, a pod. A **backend** answers
*which program runs, with what argv and env, on what health path, in what log
grammar, and with which capabilities*. They are orthogonal and compose as a
matrix (design spec §5, §6.1, decision D1): adding a backend or a driver is
O(1), not O(n*m).

Everything here is types only. It imports nothing from ``app`` so it can never
participate in an import cycle, and so a backend implementation can be read
without reading the control plane.

THE ONE THING TO KNOW BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE
----------------------------------------------
``LaunchPlan`` is argv + env and NOTHING ELSE. There is deliberately no
``entrypoint`` field, no pre-start hook, no patch list. The product invariant
(spec §2) is "we ship mainline runtimes; no monkeypatching, ever", and §6.3
chose to enforce it structurally rather than by review discipline: if the type
offers no place to mutate a runtime, no backend can. A future need that looks
like it wants an entrypoint is a signal to pin a different mainline version or
add a backend. ``tests/unit/runtime/backends/test_protocol.py`` fails if the
field -- or the vocabulary around it -- reappears in executable code anywhere
under this package.

        and is explained in "Two members, two kinds of driver" at the end of
        this Protocol -- read it before implementing either.

        The companion to ``capabilities.supports_version_pin``, and the split

#
#   bind_host must take a NAME because the caller only has one. It is

#   whose #211 docstring is an incident record we move verbatim.
#
#   version_pin_available must take an OBJECT because the answer is
#   ``getattr(driver, "supports_engine_image", False)`` -- a capability the

#   carrying a {"local": False, "docker": True} map, and sub-project D's k8s

# CAMOUFLAGED, because the subprocess case returns the correct answer for the
# wrong reason. Only a docker-fixture assertion catches it.
