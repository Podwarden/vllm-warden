"""The subprocess env for llama-server, and this backend's extra_env allowlist.

Deliberately much smaller than the vLLM backend's. llama-server is a C++ binary
that reads its model from a path we resolved: it needs no Python runtime
settings, no HuggingFace cache root, and -- see below -- no HuggingFace token.

WHY ``LLAMA_`` IS NOT AN ALLOWED PREFIX
---------------------------------------
Every llama.cpp CLI flag has an ``LLAMA_ARG_*`` environment equivalent, wired by
``set_env(...)`` on each option in common/arg.cpp. That includes LLAMA_ARG_HOST,
LLAMA_ARG_MODEL, LLAMA_ARG_PORT, LLAMA_ARG_ALIAS, LLAMA_ARG_ENDPOINT_METRICS and
LLAMA_API_KEY. An allowlisted ``LLAMA_`` prefix would therefore let a model row's
extra_env re-bind the unauthenticated OpenAI API to 0.0.0.0 (issue #211, from
the other direction), point --model at a different file, move the port out from
under the supervisor's health probe, or silently switch metrics off.

So the prefix list is ``GGML_`` only. GGML_* are backend-tuning knobs
(GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY, GGML_CUDA_P2P) with no equivalent power, and
they are the escape hatch an operator genuinely wants. This is the "narrowing,
not widening" property design spec §6.6 asks of a per-backend allowlist.

The five most dangerous LLAMA_* names are ALSO added to the global
HARD_LOCKED_ENV_KEYS so they are refused loudly at write time rather than
dropped silently -- the same treatment, and the same reasoning, the vLLM backend
gives HF_HUB_CACHE.
