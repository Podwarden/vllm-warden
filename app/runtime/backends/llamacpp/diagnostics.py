"""Turn a llama-server log tail into an actionable, operator-facing error.

The same job app/runtime/backends/vllm/diagnostics.py does for vLLM, and the
same discipline: match on STABLE TOKENS rather than exact phrasing, because the
wording drifts between builds; capture numbers opportunistically; return None on
no match so the caller keeps its generic message.

ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and for the same reason it is in the vLLM module.
An out-of-memory log routinely also contains context-sized numbers -- ggml
prints the size of the buffer it could not allocate, and llama_context prints
n_ctx_seq alongside -- so a context rule checked first would classify an OOM as
a context overflow and tell the operator to lower max_model_len. That is a loop
with no exit: the weights, not the context, are what did not fit. OOM is checked
FIRST and its message deliberately never mentions the context.

The three levers that actually differ:

  weights do not fit   -> fewer offloaded layers (n_gpu_layers), a smaller
                          quant, or more VRAM. NOT a smaller context.
  context does not fit -> a smaller ctx-size, i.e. max_model_len. This one DOES
                          respond to the obvious knob.
  wrong file           -> point at shard one, or at a file this build can load.

There is deliberately NO auto-retry here: this path only REPORTS.

WHERE THE PATTERNS COME FROM. Every rule is derived from a real captured log in
tests/fixtures/llamacpp/ except the CUDA spellings inside _OOM_RE, which are
read from the same pinned b10731 tree (ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu) because
the only NVIDIA host in scope was read-only when the fixtures were taken -- see
that directory's README. The CPU and CUDA spellings share the backend-neutral
``alloc_tensor_range`` / ``failed to allocate ... buffer`` anchors, so the rule
is exercised by the fixture either way.

IMPORT DIRECTION, stated so it is a decision and not an accident: EngineDiagnosis
is a shared type that happens to live under ``vllm/`` because sub-project B moved
it there with ``git mv``, and that file's comments are pinned verbatim by
tests/unit/runtime/backends/test_incident_comments.py. Importing it from here is
the wrong direction on paper; moving it is a real risk to nine incident records
for zero functional gain, so C imports and files the lift as an open question.
