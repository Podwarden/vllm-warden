"""The llama.cpp backend.

Deliberately thin, mirroring VllmBackend: the substance lives in ``args`` (argv
and the #211 bind policy), ``env`` (the subprocess env and its narrow
allowlist), ``diagnostics`` (the log grammar) and ``metrics`` (the ``llamacpp:``
dialect). This module is the adapter that presents them as a Backend.

llama-server is baked into the warden image and launched by the existing
in-container subprocess driver -- decision D2. Its version is therefore pinned by
the warden image, exactly as vLLM's is; bumping it is a warden release, not a
per-model choice, until sub-projects D and F land.

        Takes the driver OBJECT, not its name -- see the block comment above.

        The answer is False for EVERY driver, and not for the reason a reader
        expects. It is not that the subprocess driver cannot swap an image
        (true, but only half of it), and not that llama.cpp is unpinnable (it is
        not -- capabilities.supports_version_pin is True, because upstream
        publishes per-build tagged server images). It is that **nothing in this
        build can resolve a llama.cpp version to an image**:
        app/runtime/backends/vllm/images.py maps (channel, version) ->
        vllm/vllm-openai:vX.Y.Z and has no llama.cpp counterpart. C adds none.

        So returning getattr(driver, "supports_engine_image", False) here would
        be actively harmful rather than merely optimistic. Under a docker or k8s
        driver it would enable a version selector whose selection flows into
        _resolve_engine_image() and comes back a **vLLM** image -- launching
        vLLM under the operator's llama.cpp model name. Refusing is a
        CORRECTNESS argument, not a cautious one.

        Sub-project F must add a llama.cpp image resolver before this method may
        read its ``driver`` argument at all; at that point it should read it
        exactly as VllmBackend's does.
