"""Engine driver contract: how the vLLM engine is spawned/observed/killed.

Supervisor owns lifecycle state, locking, GPU ownership and exit-watchers.
A driver owns only the three engine primitives below. This lets the engine
run as an in-container subprocess (LocalSubprocessDriver, default) or as a
sibling container via the host Docker socket (DockerSocketDriver) without
the Supervisor caring which. Implements #160.
