"""Run-boundary sentinels for the per-model engine log.

The engine log (``{logs_dir}/{model_id}.log``) is opened O_APPEND and reused by
every load attempt, so it accumulates the output of many runs. That is what the
operator wants -- comparing attempt N-1 with attempt N is the whole point of
keeping the file -- but it broke automated diagnosis: ``_read_engine_log_tail``
handed the last 200 lines to ``diagnose_engine_log``, and a *previous* run's
traceback sitting inside that window produced a confident, specific and WRONG
explanation for the current failure, which then replaced the accurate generic
message (#234; observed twice live on 2026-09-03 -- a successful-through-
profiling run reported as "GPU ran out of memory", and a run with
``max_model_len=32768`` reported verbatim with the previous run's
"wants 262144 tokens").

The fix is a delimiter, not truncation: every driver writes one sentinel line
into the log when it opens it for a spawn, and the diagnosis reader starts from
the LAST sentinel. History stays in the file; diagnosis sees only this run.

This lives in ``app/runtime/engine/`` (next to the drivers, above any single
backend) because it is a property of how a run is *launched*, not of vLLM's or
llama.cpp's log grammar -- both benefit unchanged.
