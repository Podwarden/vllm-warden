"""Sibling-container engine driver (Docker-out-of-Docker). Asks the HOST
docker daemon (via mounted /var/run/docker.sock) to run the engine image
as a sibling container. GPUs are mapped by the host NVIDIA Container
Toolkit; volumes MUST be named (bind paths resolve on the host). The
handle's pid is the engine container's HOST pid (docker inspect .State.Pid)
which is exactly what nvidia-smi attribution keys on. Implements #160.

GPU mapping note: the Python ``docker`` SDK has NO ``gpus=`` kwarg on
``containers.run`` — that string is a docker *CLI* flag only. The SDK maps
GPUs through ``device_requests=[DeviceRequest(...)]``. We import the SDK
lazily so the default (local subprocess) path never requires it installed.
