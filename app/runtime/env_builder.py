"""Build subprocess env for vLLM. THIS FIXES THE 2026-05-08 BUG.

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is derived from model.gpu_indices (a DB column populated by the
user's wizard/CRUD selection). It is NEVER inherited from the parent process. The
parent vllm-warden container is launched with all GPUs visible (the launcher gives
the container `--gpus all` so the supervisor can dispatch any GPU); each per-model
subprocess MUST have CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES restricted to exactly that model's
gpu_indices, in the order specified, so vLLM's logical device 0 == gpu_indices[0].

extra_env keys are filtered through an allowlist and cannot override CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES,
HF_HUB_CACHE, the HF token, or PATH.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Engine shared memory (#210)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# vLLM's tensor-parallel workers talk to each other over POSIX shared memory:
# the shm_broadcast MessageQueue ring plus the custom-all-reduce CUDA-IPC
# handles. The ring is sized VLLM_MQ_MAX_CHUNK_BYTES_MB * n_chunks, and tmpfs
# backs its pages lazily -- ftruncate() and mmap() both SUCCEED even when the
# ring cannot possibly fit in /dev/shm, and the process only finds out when a
# write touches a page tmpfs then refuses to allocate. That fault arrives as
# SIGBUS, which no Python handler can turn into an exception; the engine just
# dies. That is the #210 crash: TP=4 engines taking an uncatchable SIGBUS
# inside shm_broadcast.enqueue 78s-3min into serving.
#
# The docker driver sidesteps this by giving the engine container its own
# large /dev/shm (docker_socket.ENGINE_SHM_SIZE, default 16g, plus
# ipc_mode=host). The local-subprocess driver has no equivalent lever: the
# engine is a child of the warden process and inherits the warden POD's
# /dev/shm, which on Kubernetes is the 64 MiB default unless the pod spec
# asks for an emptyDir with `medium: Memory`.
ENGINE_SHM_PATH = "/dev/shm"

# Threshold for the startup warning below. 2 GiB is the floor at which a TP>1
# engine is safe here, not a comfortable target: a TP=4 engine has been
# observed holding ~1.1 GB of ShmRingBuffer segments, on top of one
# shm_broadcast ring per message queue (160 MiB each at vLLM's stock 16 MB
# chunk size). 2 GiB clears that with headroom while sitting far enough above
# the 64 MiB container/pod default that the warning can only mean "nobody
# configured shared memory for this deployment".
ENGINE_SHM_MIN_BYTES = 2 * 1024**3

# There is deliberately NO VLLM_MQ_MAX_CHUNK_BYTES_MB default here. Capping
# the chunk size at 4 MB (a 40 MiB ring that fits inside a 64 MiB pod) was
# the stop-gap that held production up between the first SIGBUS and the real
# fix, but it costs throughput -- payloads above the chunk limit fall back to
# vLLM's slower zmq overflow copy path, which multimodal requests hit
# routinely -- and it never reaches the ShmRingBuffer segments at all, so it
# narrowed the failure window rather than closing it. The fix is a real
# /dev/shm on the pod (podwarden-core #2417: compose `shm_size:` on the api
# service renders a `medium: Memory` emptyDir), and the warning below is what
# tells an operator when that is missing. A deployment that cannot get real
# shared memory can still set the cap per model via extra_env; it is not a
# hard-locked key.

#
# PYTHONUNBUFFERED is locked even though no ALLOWED_ENV_PREFIXES currently
# accepts the bare "PYTHON" prefix (so today an operator-supplied value would

# PYTHONFAULTHANDLER / PYTHONHASHSEED — that change would otherwise let
