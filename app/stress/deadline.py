"""Per-probe deadlines (design §5.1).

Nothing else in this stack imposes one. ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is constructed
with ``timeout=None`` (``app/proxy/routes.py:569``), the scheduler's queue wait
is deliberately unbounded, and ``request_max_wall_s`` defaults to ``0.0``. So
without a deadline here, TIMEOUT is not an observable outcome at all and a
wedged engine would stall a run indefinitely.

The v1 design computed ``base + L/prefill_rate + G/decode_rate`` with the rates
fitted from the first successful probe and ×3 slack. Prefill attention is
quadratic in ``L``, so a rate fitted at 1k tokens and extrapolated linearly to
128k under-predicts badly — and a deadline that is too tight manufactures false
TIMEOUTs, each of which silently truncates the published context.

This drops the analytic model in favour of observed behaviour: scale off the
slowest probe that actually succeeded. It cannot be wrong about the shape of
the curve because it does not assume one.
