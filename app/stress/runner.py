"""The stress-test runner (design §9).

One in-process asyncio task that composes the modules around it. There is no
subprocess, no auth token of its own, no PID file, no reattach and no resume.
Those are not omissions: they are the list of things that killed the
predecessor. ``app/bench/`` did limit-finding with a CLI subprocess, SSE replay
with binary index sidecars, PID-file reattach, cooperative pause/resume and
resume-by-matrix-hash, and was deleted in ``01031a5`` — 29,048 lines across 175
files. A run here is minutes to hours and dies with the warden; if it dies, you
re-run it.

Everything in this module is composition. The oracle, the gates, the
classifier, the search, the deadline policy, the lease, the sweep planner and
the fingerprint are each their own module with their own tests, and this file
is the thing that sequences them against a live engine.

Four behaviours here are load-bearing and each exists because getting it wrong
produces a number that is confidently wrong rather than an error:

**The target is re-resolved after every restart.** ``_restart`` allocates a NEW
port (``watchdog.py:579``). A cached port means every probe after the first
crash connects to nothing, is classified CRASHED, and death-spirals through the
crash budget in seconds — turning one real crash into an exhausted budget and a
published limit far below the truth. :meth:`_target` therefore asks the
supervisor every single time and never caches.

**The real ``served_model_name`` goes on the wire.** An unknown model name is
not an error: llama-server b10731 returns 200 with empty content and
``finish_reason: "length"`` (recorded, ``tests/fixtures/stress/llamacpp_recorded.json``).
That trips REASONING_ONLY and ABRUPT, so a harness that sends the model *row id*
publishes its own bug as model degradation.

**Neighbours are watched but never touched.** Co-residency is normal, a
crashing engine can take a co-resident one down with it, and the co-resident
model holds no lease. We poll their health between probes and abort the run if
one goes unhealthy — and we never take a lease on them, because their recovery
is the watchdog's job and standing it down for a model we are not testing is
strictly worse than doing nothing.

**The prefix-cache defeat is verified, not assumed.** vLLM's cache is
block-aligned from position 0 and on by default; concurrent probes sharing a
prefix get their KV deduplicated and the concurrency axis then reports a number
no real traffic can reach. Probes carry unique preambles, and the engine's own
``cached_tokens`` is checked afterwards — if it is high, the axis is measuring
deduplicated KV and its number is withheld rather than published.
