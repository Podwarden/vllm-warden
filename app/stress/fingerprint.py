"""The measurement fingerprint (design §7.3).

A measured limit is only true of the exact thing it was measured on. This is
what decides when it stops being true — and therefore when a client must stop
being told it.

Getting the scope wrong is dangerous in both directions. Too narrow and we
serve a client a number taken from different hardware or a different engine
build. Too wide and every measurement expires on contact and the feature
produces nothing.

Three of the components below are here because of measurements taken on
pw-bonus on 2026-09-03, not because they seemed prudent:

* **GPU identity**, because the same model, file and arguments crashed at
  ~2.2k tokens on one card and ran clean to 24,376 on another in the same host.
* **ECC mode**, because enabling it cut usable VRAM from 16,384 to 15,360 MiB.
* **Neighbours**, because co-residency is normal and a limit measured while a
  neighbour held several GB is not true once that neighbour unloads.

Known gap, stated rather than hidden: a reload with *identical* configuration
produces an identical fingerprint, so a measurement survives it. Whether that
is correct is unknown — the observed non-determinism suggests one load may be
luckier than another. The run row carries ``loads_since_measurement`` so this
can be tested rather than assumed.
