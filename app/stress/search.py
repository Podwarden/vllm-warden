"""The replicated-oracle search (design §3).

Plain binary search is INVALID for this problem. Each bound move is
irreversible, and near the threshold the failure probability is around 0.5 —
measured on pw-bonus 2026-09-03, where the same prompt size crashed on one
attempt and passed on the next. A single query at the midpoint is then wrong
half the time, the error compounds, and the algorithm cannot detect it.

The fix is to replicate the oracle rather than abandon bisection. Define
``PASS_N(x)`` = "N consecutive trials at x all passed". Since

    Pr[PASS_N(x)] = (1 - p(x))**N

is monotone decreasing in ``p``, ``PASS_N`` remains a valid stochastic
threshold oracle — it simply sits on a lower contour. Bisecting on it converges
where ``(1-p)**N = 0.5``, i.e. ``p = 1 - 0.5**(1/N)``. The bias is downward,
which is the safe direction, and it is quantifiable, which is what lets the
contract publish it as a number rather than a hand-wave.

That argument establishes monotonicity in ``p``. Bisection additionally needs
``p`` monotone in ``x``, which nothing guarantees here — see
``SearchOutcome.is_non_monotone`` for why that matters and what we do about it.
