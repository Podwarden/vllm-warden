"""Stress-test API surface (design §7.1) and the publication rules (§7.4, §7.5).

Two endpoints and one shared publication layer:

* ``POST /api/models/{id}/stress`` — start a run. Admission only; the run
  itself is an in-process asyncio task owned by ``app/stress/runner.py``.
* ``GET /api/models/{id}/capabilities`` — the full operator-facing record.
* ``warden_block()`` — what ``GET /v1/models`` adds to each entry. It lives
  here rather than in the proxy so there is exactly one implementation of the
  rule that decides whether a client is told a number at all.

Three things in here are load-bearing and are not plumbing:

**Starting a run is an operator action, never a data-plane one.** A stress
test deliberately crashes a production engine. An API token (``vw_…``) is a
credential handed to a client application so it can send completions; it must
never be able to take a GPU down. The design left this unstated. Note that
``require_jwt`` would already reject a ``vw_`` token with a confusing "invalid
token" 401 — ``require_operator`` turns that into a 403 that says why.

**``recommended_config`` never reaches ``/v1/models``.** It describes a
configuration the model is *not currently running* (§6.2). Telling a client it
may send 96k-token prompts to an engine allocated for 32k produces a refusal
the client has no way to interpret. It is returned by ``/capabilities``, which
is operator-facing, and by nothing else.

**On stale, we do not fall back to ``declared``.** ``declared`` is the number
the measurement corrected downward. Falling back silently *widens* the
advertised context back to a value already known not to work, which is the one
outcome worse than serving a slightly out-of-date correction. A stale value
ships as a flagged ceiling and can only ever move down — including down to the
current declared value, when the engine was reloaded smaller than the
configuration that was measured.

#
# The runner stamps a fingerprint onto the run row; every reader recomputes one
# and compares. That only works if every component is derivable by a reader
# holding nothing but app.state and the model row, which forced two documented
# departures from §7.3:
#
#   * ``max_num_batched_tokens`` is read from the CONFIGURED argv, not observed
#     from the live engine. A reader cannot ask an engine that may not be
#     running, and a component only one side can compute makes every
#     measurement permanently stale — which is strictly worse than missing the
#     case where an engine default changes under us.
#   * ``driver_version`` costs a second nvidia-smi invocation, so it is
#     resolved once per process and memoised. Resolving it lazily WITHOUT the
#     memo would flip the fingerprint the first time it succeeded and mark
#     every prior measurement stale.
#
# ``ecc_enabled`` is passed as False for every card, on purpose: the live probe
# does not report ECC state, but ``memory_total_mib`` — which it does report —
# is what actually moves when ECC is toggled (16,384 → 15,360 MiB, measured
# 2026-09-03). The observable proxy is already in the fingerprint.
