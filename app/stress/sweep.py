"""Planning the configuration sweep, and choosing the answer (design §6).

This module answers the question the feature exists for — *what should
``max_model_len`` be for this model on this hardware?* — rather than merely
reporting where things broke. A breaking point is interesting; a setting you
can apply is useful.

Two rules govern everything here.

**Prediction prunes; measurement decides.** ``app/models/fit.py`` can tell us a
candidate is certainly too large for the VRAM present, and that is worth acting
on because every reload costs up to ``load_timeout_s`` = 600 seconds. It cannot
tell us a candidate will work: raising qwen3.8-27b from 65,536 to 131,072 cost
approximately zero additional VRAM (measured on pw-bonus, 2026-09-03), because
sliding-window attention makes long contexts cost sub-linearly. So the estimate
is least reliable exactly where the answer lives. No predicted number is ever
published — prediction only ever removes candidates that cannot possibly work.

**Sweeping is expensive.** Candidates are few and geometric. A dense ladder
would spend hours to distinguish values no operator would set differently.
