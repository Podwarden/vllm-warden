"""Resolving a model's own context ceiling (design §6).

The sweep needs to know how far up it is even allowed to look. Without a
ceiling it can only ask *"is the current setting too ambitious?"* — never
*"can we go higher?"*, which is half of the question this feature exists to
answer.

**A running engine is usually not a valid source, and this is the trap.** What
it reports is what it was *configured* with. Measured on pw-bonus, 2026-09-03,
llama-server b10731 serving qwen3.8-27b started with ``--ctx-size 131072``::

    GET /props  ->  default_generation_settings.n_ctx = 131072

That is our own flag echoed back. Treating it as a ceiling makes the sweep
circular: it would cap the ladder at the setting we are trying to improve on,
confirm it, and report ``limited_by: model_ceiling`` as though the model could
go no further — a confident answer derived entirely from the input.

There is exactly one case where the engine *is* informative: when we imposed
no limit at all, both engines fall back to the model's own maximum, so the
reported value is the trained ceiling rather than an echo. A value strictly
greater than what we configured is also real evidence, since it cannot have
come from our flag.

The portable source is the model's own config — ``max_position_embeddings``,
which ``app/models/discovery.py`` already keeps. GGUF repos frequently ship no
``config.json`` (``unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF`` lists ``notebook.ipynb``,
``params`` and ``template``, and no config), so ``None`` is a normal outcome
and not an error. The sweep degrades to the narrower question rather than
inventing a number.
