"""Excluding probes that cannot discriminate (design §4.3).

A probe that trips a gate at the BASELINE condition tells us nothing about
where the model breaks: it reads the same at the reference length as at the
axis maximum, so every rung fails and no value is ever confirmed. It does not
find a limit — it hides one.

Measured on the second production run, 2026-09-04, `gpt-oss-20b-gguf` with the
budget fix in place and a clean baseline otherwise::

    needle   -> pass at 1024, 960, 896, 8192
    summary  -> repeating at EVERY length, baseline included
    result: raw_confirmed 0, first_observed_failure 1024, nothing published

Asked the same question directly the model answered in two clean sentences, so
that `repeating` was a false positive — but the argument for exclusion does not
rest on that. A signal that is constant across the whole axis cannot locate a
threshold on it, whether or not the signal is "correct".

``gates.py`` already refuses to judge against a degenerate baseline for the
SHORT gate. This applies the same rule to the rest.

    Quarantine used to rest on a single sample, which contradicts the argument
    the rest of the search is built on: ``search.py`` replicates every ladder
    verdict because one sample near a threshold is a coin flip. The baseline
    shapes the whole run and was deciding on one.

    The cost of being wrong is asymmetric. Keeping a genuinely broken probe
    wastes some probes and it fails again at the first rung. Retiring a good one
    removes an oracle permanently -- and with only two ladder probes, two such
    mistakes abort the run outright, which is exactly what happened twice on
    2026-09-04.

    The two failures need not be the SAME gate: what disqualifies a probe is
    that it cannot produce a usable reference, not the particular way it fails.
