"""Did a run actually measure anything? (design §7.2)

Separate from the repo and from the routes because both need the same answer
and neither should own it — and because keeping it dependency-free lets it be
tested without a database.

The distinction this draws is not pedantic. A run that COMPLETED and a run that
MEASURED something are different states, and conflating them cost an operator
their retest: after the reasoning-budget bug (2026-09-04) a run completed
having confirmed nothing at all, and because it was `completed`, matched the
fingerprint, and was neither non-monotone nor traffic-tainted, it satisfied
every condition `current_for` checks and held the six-hour cooldown. Pressing
"Stress test" returned `200 reused` naming that dead run — no new run, no
error, and no way out, because the UI reveals `force` only on a 409.

A run that learned nothing is the strongest possible argument for running
again, not against it.
