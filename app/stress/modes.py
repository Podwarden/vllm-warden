"""Comparing what two run modes actually establish.

A cached measurement may be reused only when it answers the question being
asked. The cooldown originally asked "is there a recent measurement for this
fingerprint?" and never "does that measurement answer THIS request?", so a
`conservative` run blocked a `thorough` one and the operator was handed back a
result that could not contain what they had asked for.

The modes differ in what they establish, not merely in how long they take
(``PROFILES`` in ``runner.py``):

* ``conservative`` — crash budget 0, confirm 5/5, one needle offset, no sweep
* ``quick``        — crash budget 2, otherwise as conservative
* ``thorough``     — crash budget 4, confirm 7/7, three needle offsets, and the
  configuration sweep, which is the ONLY source of ``recommended_config``

So `thorough` is the only mode that can answer "what should I set
``max_model_len`` to?" at all.
