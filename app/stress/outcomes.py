"""Outcome classification for one stress probe (design §5.2, §5.3).

Seven classes, evaluated in a fixed order. The order is load-bearing:
**liveness is checked before HTTP status**, because a dying engine can emit a
500 on its way down, and reading the status first would file a crash as an
error and let the search keep climbing into it.

The class that most needed rebuilding is REFUSED. It is the only class that
stops an axis *without* spending crash budget, so a false positive silently
truncates a published limit and a false negative wastes a crash. v1 confirmed
refusals by re-probing at 0.9x the failing size — against a geometric ladder,
where the first failing rung lies in (R, 2R]. That lands below the true
threshold only when rung <= 1.111R: log2(1.111) = 15.2% of the interval. So
85% of genuine refusals were misclassified, which is exactly the defect this
whole feature exists to fix, reintroduced inside the fix.

Everything here is pure. Liveness, health and confirmation are gathered by the
runner and passed in as evidence.
