"""Deciding whether a measured setting may be applied (design §6.4).

Applying is the only action in this feature that CHANGES the model rather than
observing it, and it is not cheap: the settings patch refuses to touch a loaded
model, so applying means unload -> persist -> load. The model stops serving for
the length of a load, and the measurement that justified the change describes
the configuration being replaced -- by construction, applying invalidates its
own evidence.

That is why it is OFFERED and never automatic, and why each refusal here exists:
applying anyway would leave the model in a state the measurement does not
describe.
