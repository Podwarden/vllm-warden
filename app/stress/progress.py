"""What a run reports about itself while it is still running.

Observations are written once, at finish. A thorough run takes hours, so until
this existed the modal showed "0 probe(s)", "No probes recorded yet", and a bar
rendered FULL — which reads as "finished" rather than "unknown", the worst of
the three possible wrong answers.

The ETA is derived, never extrapolated. Each phase declares how many steps it
plans, and the estimate applies THAT PHASE's measured pace to its own
remainder. Carrying a pace across phases would be meaningless: a length rung is
one HTTP probe, a sweep candidate is an engine reload that can take ten
minutes. A phase that cannot know its own total reports no ETA rather than a
guess — the same rule the published limits follow.
