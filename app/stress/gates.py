"""Quality gates — the stress test's primary oracle (design §4.2).

A stress run fails when the model stops producing USABLE OUTPUT. The engine
dying is one way that happens and not the most common one; the more useful
signal is that the model is still answering and the answers have gone bad.

Every gate here is a HARD BINARY, deliberately. A graded "coherence score"
would need a threshold with no defensible value, and general hallucination is
not detectable by any cheap, deterministic, model-agnostic means. What IS
detectable is what actually happens at a context limit: answers get short, get
cut off, start looping, or stop following the instruction. Those are binary,
objective, and exactly what a bisection oracle needs.

Everything here is pure. The two impure inputs — whether the repetition
detector tripped, and whether the grader passed — are computed by the probe
client and passed in as verdicts, which is what keeps the whole oracle
testable without a GPU.

    gates are describing our own configuration rather than the model.

    Measured on `gpt-oss-20b-gguf` (llama.cpp, 2026-09-04): at ``max_tokens=16``
