"""Probe generation and grading (design §4.5, §4.6).

Everything is generated from one template plus a seed. There is no corpus
directory, no manifest hash and no integrity test: bench-v2 had all three —
seven size buckets, dozens of JSON files — and they were a meaningful fraction
of the 23k lines that got it deleted.

Two properties here are load-bearing rather than tidy:

**The unique preamble defeats prefix caching.** vLLM's prefix cache is on by
default and block-aligned from the start of the prompt. Concurrent probes that
share a prefix have their KV deduplicated, so the concurrency axis would report
a number far above anything real traffic achieves. The entropy therefore has to
sit at position 0 — merely being present somewhere is not enough — and it has
to differ per concurrent slot, so simultaneous probes cannot dedupe against
each other either.

**Grading is normalised.** A model that hyphenates or spaces an answer
differently has not failed to recall it. With M/M confirmation, one formatting
quirk would kill a rung and silently truncate the published context.
