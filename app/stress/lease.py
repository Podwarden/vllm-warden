"""The stress lease (design §5.5).

A stress run deliberately crashes an engine. ``RestartBudget``
(``app/runtime/watchdog.py:209``) allows 3 restarts per 3600s and, on
exhaustion, writes ``status='failed'`` and leaves the model dead until a human
intervenes. Three deliberate crashes reach that. The watchdog also needs
``interval 30s × threshold 3`` ≈ 90s merely to notice each death, which the
runner beats by an order of magnitude because it is already probing.

So for the duration of a run the watchdog stands down for that one model and
the runner owns recovery.

**Check this in ``wants_restart()``**, which both watchdog paths consult — not
in ``check_once``. ``check_once`` only probes rows whose status is ``loaded``
(``watchdog.py:761``), but a real crash flips the row to ``failed`` first, so
recovery actually runs through ``restart_crashed_models``
(``watchdog.py:680``). Guarding only the first leaves the path that actually
fires unguarded, and then both it and the runner call ``_restart`` — which
force-unloads unconditionally (``watchdog.py:546``) — so whichever loses the
race destroys the other's freshly loaded engine.

**The lease is a heartbeat, not a long expiry.** A TTL sized to the run (the
v1 proposal was 2× expected runtime, i.e. six hours on ``thorough``) leaves a
production model unsupervised for that whole window if the runner dies — and
``finally`` does not run on SIGKILL, on a container restart, or when an
exception is raised inside the ``finally`` itself. Renewing every ~15s against
a 60s TTL is the same amount of code and bounds the exposure to a minute.
