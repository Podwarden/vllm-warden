"""SSE accumulation for engine-direct probes (design §9.1).

Probes go straight to ``127.0.0.1:{engine_port}``, not through the warden's
own ``/v1``. That is not a shortcut: ``PriorityScheduler`` admits
``VW_PROXY_MAX_INFLIGHT`` — default 16 — per engine, so a concurrency run
through the proxy could never test past 16 and would be measuring the warden
rather than the engine. Going direct also sidesteps the token rate limiter, the
priority push-down and ``runaway_mode``'s body rewrite.

The cost is that none of the proxy's streaming machinery is reusable:
``warmup_probe`` is a single non-streaming POST, and ``_feed_detector`` takes
an event already parsed by the proxy's forward path. So the harness needs its
own SSE client. Parsing lives here, separated from transport, so the whole of
it is testable by feeding lines with no network and no GPU.
