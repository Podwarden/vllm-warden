"""Persistence for stress runs (design §7.2).

Results are keyed on ``(model_id, fingerprint)``, not on ``model_id`` alone.
The same model measured at two context sizes produces two rows and both are
true — neither supersedes the other, because they describe different
configurations. That is what makes the reload sweep expressible at all.

Reading is deliberately narrow: ``current_for`` is the only way a client-facing
surface gets a number, and it refuses to return anything that is not a
completed, publishable run under the exact fingerprint asked for.

          carrying full confidence.

        * ``traffic_observed = 0`` — KV is a shared pool, so foreign traffic
          moved the measurement by an unknown amount.

        A fifth condition cannot be expressed in this SQL and is applied after
        the fetch: the run must actually have MEASURED something. Completing
        and measuring are different states, and treating them as one cost an

        the six-hour cooldown, so pressing the button returned `200 reused`
        naming the dead run, with no error and no way out. A run that learned
