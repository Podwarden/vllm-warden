"""HF cache management API.

Three endpoints, all gated by ``require_jwt``:

- ``GET /api/cache/models``                 — list every cached repo with
  size, mtime, and the model rows (if any) that own it.
- ``DELETE /api/cache/models/{repo:path}``  — drop a single repo's cache,
  refusing if any matching model row is active and warning if any are
  ``pulled``/``idle`` (overridable via ``?force=true``).
- ``POST /api/cache/models/gc``             — sweep orphans + stale
  ``failed`` rows in one shot. Dry-run preview by default.

See ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-hf-cache-management-design.md``
and vllm-warden#114 for the full design rationale.
