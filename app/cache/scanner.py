"""Pure-sync HF cache walker.

Decoupled from FastAPI so unit tests can drop a few directories into a
tmpdir and assert on the returned list without standing up an app.
Route handlers wrap calls in ``asyncio.to_thread`` so a slow walk on a
large cache doesn't block the event loop.

The HF library writes its cache as ``models--<org>--<name>/`` directories
under either ``HF_HOME`` (``$HF_HOME/hub/``) or ``HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE``
(directly under the configured root). vllm-warden's ``VW_HF_CACHE_DIR``
maps to whichever the runtime container ends up exporting, so the
scanner probes BOTH ``<root>/`` and ``<root>/hub/`` and MERGES the two
layouts for a given repo id into a single :class:`CachedRepo` — one row
per repo, never two.

Byte counting is deduplicated at the inode level, not the path level:
every file (including a ``snapshots/<rev>/file`` symlink, followed to
its target) is keyed by ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` in a set shared across
BOTH layouts for that repo, so a blob referenced from ``blobs/<sha>``
directly and again via a symlink under ``snapshots/`` — or shared
between the ``<root>/`` and ``<root>/hub/`` layouts — contributes its
bytes exactly once (vllm-warden#238: the previous path-level dedup let
the symlink's target bytes get summed a second time on top of the real
file, doubling reported size and, since the two layouts were never
merged, also reporting each repo twice).

    ``roots`` is every directory that backs this repo (typically just
    ``<cache_root>/models--<org>--<name>``, but a repo split across the
    ``<root>/`` and ``<root>/hub/`` layouts passes both). ``seen`` is an
    ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` set the caller creates per-repo and threads
    through every root here — that's what makes the count correct:

    - The HF cache stores real bytes under ``blobs/<sha>`` and symlinks
      them from ``snapshots/<rev>/file``. ``os.stat`` (follow_symlinks=
      True, the default) on the symlink returns the BLOB's inode, so the
      blob and every symlink pointing at it collapse to one ``seen``
      entry — the bytes are added exactly once no matter how many
      snapshot revisions reference it.
    - The same set is shared across the ``<root>/`` and ``<root>/hub/``
      directories for one repo (see ``scan_hf_cache``), so a file that
      happens to be hardlinked or symlinked between the two layouts is
      likewise counted once, not once per layout.

    Tolerates partially-unreadable subtrees: a single ``PermissionError``
    on a blob is logged and skipped, the rest of the walk continues.
