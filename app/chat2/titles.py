# Spec §4.2 step 9: the title call runs at the LOWEST priority — it is
# cosmetic, and must never sit in front of a user's interactive turn.
#
# vLLM's priority scheduler orders its waiting queue by (priority, arrival)
# ASCENDING, so a HIGHER number is served LATER, and the proxy maps the
# warden's 0..9 token priority (9 = highest) onto `vllm_priority =
# -warden_priority`, i.e. the band -9..0 (app/proxy/routes.py). It also never
# overrides a priority the client set itself. Sending +9 therefore parks the
# title request behind every possible warden-mapped request, including
# default (priority-0) traffic — which a plain `0` would only tie with.
