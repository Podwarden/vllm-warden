"""The streaming turn endpoints — `POST /api/chat2/chats/{id}/turns` plus the
detached-turn surface (`GET .../turn/live`, `POST .../turn/abort`) (spec §4.2).

The turn is DETACHED from its HTTP response: after the pre-flight checks and
the user/tool-row persist, the whole generation pipeline — the loopback call
to the warden's own OpenAI-compatible proxy (so the real rate-limit /
priority / usage-rollup pipeline runs unmodified), the `ChatEvent`
normalisation, the assistant-row/ledger/title persistence — runs on its own
`asyncio.Task` (`_run_turn`, the *runner*), which appends every SSE frame to
an `app.chat2.live.LiveTurn` entry. The HTTP response is merely a replayable
*subscriber* over those frames. Consequences:

* a client disconnect cancels only the subscriber generator — the runner
  streams on to completion and persists the full assistant row
  (finish_reason stop/length/...), its usage, the ledger row and the titles;
* navigation/reload can re-attach: `GET /chats/{id}` exposes `live_turn`, and
  `GET /chats/{id}/turn/live` replays the frames byte-identically and then
  follows the live tail;
* stopping a turn is now an explicit `POST /chats/{id}/turn/abort`, which
  cancels the runner; the runner's CancelledError path persists the partial
  tail as `aborted` (spec §4.2 step 8) and emits a terminal
  `done {finishReason: "aborted"}` frame for any remaining subscribers.

Ordering guarantees inside the runner (spec §4.2 steps 7-9), unchanged from
the pre-detached implementation:

* the upstream response and client are closed **first** in the `finally`, so
  the proxy releases its scheduler slot exactly as the playground does today;
* the active-request counter is exited next (the Playwright leak test polls it);
* persistence is spawned as its own task and awaited through
  `asyncio.shield`, so cancelling the runner (explicit abort, app shutdown)
  still lands an `aborted` assistant row and its ledger entry;
* the lock is released from that task's completion callback, so "released
  last" holds on the abort path too. The lock is acquired before the runner
  is spawned and released only by it — a second POST while the runner lives
  is a 409 `turn_in_flight` regardless of any client's connection state.

The runner is a plain task, so cancellation is single-shot — but app shutdown
(`asyncio.wait_for` in the lifespan) can cancel a second time, and the anyio
quirk of re-delivered cancellation still applies wherever a scope is
involved, so every teardown await stays wrapped in `_close_safely` /
`asyncio.shield` exactly as before.

There is deliberately no wall-clock timeout around the upstream call here:
the loopback proxy enforces `settings.request_max_wall_s`
(`VW_REQUEST_MAX_WALL_S`) server-side and ends the stream, which the runner
sees as a normal upstream EOF.

Failure surfacing (spec §4.5): pre-flight failures (chat gone, context full,
tools unsupported, budget) are `HTTPException`s carrying the shared chat2
`{code, message}` envelope (`errors.api_error`); anything that happens once we
have started talking to the model is an `error` event **and** a persisted
assistant row carrying `error_json`, so the failure is visible in history with
a Retry affordance.
