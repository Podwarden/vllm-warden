"""Orphan collector: reconciles attachment rows against files on disk, expires
stale drafts, evicts attachment groups past the TTL, and evicts the oldest
groups when a user is near their storage quota. See spec §3.

Follows the ``app.runtime.stats_pruner`` pattern: a pure ``collect_once()``
for tests plus a ``run_gc_forever()`` loop that swallows and logs any
iteration failure so the background task never dies.
