"""GET /api/system/engine — the active engine driver's capability.

The frontend Try-stack panel (#177) needs to know whether the running
deployment can swap the engine container image to a pinned vLLM version. Under
the default in-container subprocess driver it CANNOT — the vLLM version is
fixed by the warden image — so the version selector must be disabled and the
operator told why, instead of silently launching the warden-baked version.

``vllm_version`` is the vLLM package version baked into THIS image. We read it
cheaply via ``importlib.metadata`` (no ``import vllm`` — that drags in torch
and is far too heavy for a metadata read) and cache it at import time. It is
``None`` in environments where vLLM isn't installed (dev shell, pytest).

Sub-project B adds ``GET /api/system/backends``, which generalises this from
one driver capability to each backend's capabilities resolved against the
active driver. ``/api/system/engine``
is kept BYTE-IDENTICAL as a deprecated alias so an old UI against a new API
does not break mid-rollout; it is removed no earlier than the release after the
frontend stops calling it.

    CLIENTS GATE CONTROLS ON version_pin_available. Enabling a version selector
    because the engine "supports" pinning, on a box that cannot swap the image,
    offers a control that silently does nothing. Advertising both is what lets
    the UI disable the control AND explain why, instead of a load failing 40
    seconds in.

    A third field carries the "why":

      version_pin_reason     non-null EXACTLY when version_pin_available is
                             false; rendered verbatim beside the disabled
