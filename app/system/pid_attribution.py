"""PID → model_id attribution for the live GPU probe.

Strategy
--------
The supervisor spawns each vLLM model with ``start_new_session=True`` (see
``app/runtime/supervisor.py``). That means every model gets its own POSIX
session, and the parent PID becomes the session-group leader: PGID == parent
PID. Worker processes spawned by vLLM under tensor parallelism inherit that
session, so they share the same pgrp.

Given the set of supervisor-tracked parent PIDs, we can attribute any process
PID to a model by reading ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` field 5 (pgrp) and looking it
up in the parent-pid → model_id map.

If ``/proc`` is unavailable (e.g. non-Linux dev box), or a PID has already
exited, attribution returns ``None`` and the caller treats the holder as
external.
