    # bus id (the join key for the ``-q -d TEMPERATURE`` limits), temperature,
    # fan, power draw + the card's own limit, ECC mode, P-state and SM clock.

    # card has no fan.speed, a card in a VM often has no power sensor — and
    # each degrades to ``None`` on its own. ``None`` renders as "not reported";
    # it is never folded into 0, because "0 W" and "no power sensor" are
    # different facts about the hardware.

    # Columns 17-20 are the PCIe link: generation now / negotiated max, width
    # now / max. Two traps, both seen on a real host. (a) gen.current is 1 on
    # an idle card — PCIe downshifts to save power and climbs under load, so
    # a low CURRENT generation is normal and must not be flagged. (b) Width
    # does not downshift: x4 against a max of x16 is a card in a x4 slot or
    # on a riser, a permanent ceiling, and on a host with no usable NVLink
    # it is the only path between cards — that one IS worth a warning.
