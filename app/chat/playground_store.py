"""In-process cache for the `vw-playground` bearer-token plaintext.

The chat playground (S8 of the vllm-warden overhaul, see plan §S8) needs a
real bearer token to call `/v1/chat/completions` — that path is locked
behind ``require_bearer`` and we don't want the playground to invent a
JWT-only shortcut around the proxy's rate-limit / priority machinery.

The trade-off this module exists to negotiate:

* Tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes in SQLite; the plaintext is only
  visible at create time (this is by design — see ``app/auth/bearer.py``
  and the rotate flow in ``app/db/repos/tokens.py``).
* The playground needs the plaintext to forge a Bearer header on the
  user's behalf without exposing the secret to the browser (one of the
  locked S8 risks: "do not put a bearer token in browser memory").

The compromise is this in-process singleton: when the chat page first
mounts, ``POST /api/chat/playground/ensure`` either reuses a previously
minted plaintext (cache hit) or rotates / creates a fresh `vw-playground`
token and stashes the plaintext here. The cache lives in
``app.state.playground_store`` so a container restart wipes it — the
ensure handler treats "row exists in DB but plaintext absent from cache"
as a recreate signal so a restart doesn't strand the playground.
