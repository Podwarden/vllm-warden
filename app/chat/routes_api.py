"""Chat-playground HTTP surface — JWT-authed wrapper around `/v1/chat/completions`.

Three endpoints land here:

* ``POST /api/chat/playground/ensure``  — idempotently mint the
  ``vw-playground`` system token; cache the plaintext server-side.
* ``POST /api/chat/completions``        — JWT-authed SSE proxy that
  forges the playground Bearer header server-side and streams upstream
  tokens back to the browser.
* ``GET  /api/admin/active-requests``   — counter-only diagnostic for
  the Playwright happy-path leak test (MED risk in the S8 plan).

The proxy deliberately does **not** ship the bearer plaintext to the
browser (the "do not put a bearer token in browser memory" risk in the
S8 plan); the playground UI uses its session JWT to call this endpoint
and the server does the rest.
