"""Runtime + per-model settings API.

GET/PATCH `/api/settings/runtime` is the single read/write surface for the
runtime tunables seeded by migration 0010 (plus the admin_username derived
from the users table and the admin_password sentinel). The PATCH response
classifies each changed key into one of:

  * "none"           — takes effect immediately, no restart needed
  * "model-reload"   — already-loaded models won't pick this up until
                       they're unloaded + reloaded (e.g. hf_token)
  * "warden-restart" — process-level config bound at import time
                       (e.g. session TTLs); operator must restart warden

The classification is returned in `requires_restart_kinds` so the FE can
nudge the operator to take the appropriate follow-up action.

The legacy `POST /api/settings` shape (allowed_gpu_indices + hf_token) is
removed. Phase 1 of the redesign moved the wizard onto `/api/setup`, so
nothing in-tree depended on the old POST contract. HF-token validation
semantics are preserved here: a PATCH that supplies `hf_token` calls
`validate_hf_token` first, and on ValueError returns 422 with the message
(same shape as the prior endpoint).

Admin credentials (`admin_username`, `admin_password`) are routed to the
`users` table — NOT the settings KV — because the login path reads only
from `users`. A PATCH that writes them into settings KV would be a
write-only operation that quietly breaks future password changes AND
leaks the plaintext into the DB. See routing block in `patch_runtime`.

Per-model settings (Task 3.3) live on a sibling router `model_settings_router`
mounted under `/api/models/{model_id}/settings`.

# max_batch_size, #106's hf_config_repo / tokenizer_repo) silently fall
# off the patchable surface even though every other layer treats them
# as operator-tunable. The fix is to derive the allowlist from
# `dataclasses.fields(ModelRow)` MINUS an explicit `_NEVER_PATCH`
# blocklist that names lifecycle-owned and DB-managed columns. New
# columns become patchable by default; locking one requires adding it
# to `_NEVER_PATCH` with a comment explaining why.
#
# (The plan §S3 wording says `ModelRow.__fields__` — that's the
# Pydantic accessor; ModelRow is a `@dataclass`, so we use
# `dataclasses.fields` instead. Same semantics for our purpose: the
# canonical field name registry.)
