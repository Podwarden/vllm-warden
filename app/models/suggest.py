"""Pure heuristic that backs ``GET /api/models/{id}/suggest-config``.

Per the S3 plan (#113), this module returns STARTING POINTS for the load
configuration — it is NEVER auto-applied. The FE wizard renders the
suggestions alongside the row's current values; the operator decides
whether to copy them across.

Heuristics today (deliberately conservative; expand in S4+ as we learn):

* ``gpu_memory_utilization`` — fixed at ``0.92`` of available VRAM. The
  remainder leaves room for the activation tensors + the KV cache vLLM
  allocates dynamically. Same default used by the upstream vLLM examples.
* ``max_model_len`` — pulled from the model's ``config.max_position_embeddings``
  when present. Returns ``None`` (not a guess) when the config is
  missing — the row default applies and the wizard surfaces a warning.
* ``kv_cache_dtype`` — recommended as ``'fp8'`` ONLY for AWQ-quantized
  models. AWQ weights are int4 in storage but dequantized to bf16 at
  matmul time, so the KV cache dominates VRAM at long context; cutting
  KV cache to fp8 buys ~2× headroom with negligible quality loss in
  practice. Other quant families (GPTQ, GGUF, plain fp16) keep the
  default bf16 KV cache. AWQ detection is "name marker in hf_repo OR
  filename" plus a ``quantization_config.quant_method == 'awq'`` check.

The endpoint payload ALWAYS includes the ``disclaimer`` field so a
downstream consumer that auto-applies the values ignores a contract
red flag.
