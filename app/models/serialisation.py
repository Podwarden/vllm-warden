"""The single place a ``ModelRow`` becomes an API response.

Why this module exists, and why it is not just three more keys in two dicts:

``GET /api/models/{id}`` and ``GET /api/models`` each hand-built a dict literal.
Migration 0027 added ``backend`` and 0028 added ``mmproj_filename`` /
``n_gpu_layers``; ``ModelRow`` and ``_decode_row`` grew all three, the write path
persisted them correctly, and both read paths silently dropped them. The
operator saw the consequence as "every model reports Engine: vllm" on a model
that was demonstrably running ``llama-server`` — the UI's ``backend ?? "vllm"``
fallback firing on a key that was never sent.

That is a drift bug, not a typo, and it recurs on every migration. The remedy is
to make the *whole row* the default and require an explicit decision to withhold
a column:

* ``_serialise`` starts from ``dataclasses.asdict`` and subtracts. A new column
  is therefore published unless someone names it in ``_PRIVATE_FIELDS`` or
  ``_ENGINE_FIELDS``, and ``tests/unit/models/test_model_serialisation.py``
  fails the build if it is in neither.
* ``model_detail`` and ``model_summary`` both call ``_serialise`` and return the
  SAME dict. #237 is why: ``/api/models`` used to hand-maintain a second, leaner
  allowlist (``SUMMARY_FIELDS``) on the theory that the list endpoint is polled
  every 2s and cheapness there is a real constraint. In practice that second
  allowlist is exactly what let ``max_model_len`` / ``gpu_memory_utilization`` /
  ``extra_args`` — and, worse, all three tri-state capability flags — reach
  ``GET /api/models/{id}`` while staying invisible on ``GET /api/models``, so a
  list view could not show engine sizing at all and a write-then-verify against
  the list endpoint looked like the API silently ignored the write. A model row
  is a few dozen scalars; serialising it twice is not the expensive part of a 2s
  poll. Keeping two allowlists in lockstep by hand was. One function, called
  from both routes, makes that drift structurally impossible instead of merely
  fixed.

Sub-project E appends ``actions`` and ``backend_verdicts`` to both responses.
Those are computed, not persisted, so they belong at the call site on top of
what these functions return -- this module deliberately does not grow a notion
of lifecycle legality, which is E's alone.
