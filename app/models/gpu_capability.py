"""GPU compute-capability × quant/dtype capability rules (#176).

Pure functions, no I/O. Given the *minimum* CUDA compute capability across
the selected GPUs (e.g. ``8.6`` for an RTX A4000, sm_86) and a candidate's
quant/dtype signals from ``config.json``, return human-readable warnings
about combinations the hardware can't run *well*.

This is a **warn, never block** layer: the wizard still lets the operator
download anything, but surfaces "this will be emulated / unsupported" so a
sm_86 A4000 user doesn't pick an FP8 build expecting native FP8 throughput
(the 2026-05-26 emulated-fp8 finding) or a GGUF/AWQ dead-end.

Adding a new architecture = one line in the matrix below. The thresholds
are CUDA compute-capability floors per feature:

* FP8 (E4M3/E5M2) native tensor cores → Ada sm_89 (cc 8.9). Pre-Ada runs
  it emulated (slow, often inaccurate).
* NVFP4 / FP4 → Blackwell sm_100 (cc 10.0).
* bfloat16 → Ampere sm_80 (cc 8.0). Turing and older lack native bf16.
* Marlin INT4 (AWQ/GPTQ) → Turing sm_75 (cc 7.5).

    ``compute_cap`` is the **minimum** compute capability across the selected
    GPUs (the weakest card gates what the whole tensor-parallel group can do).
    When it's ``None`` (driver reported ``[Not Supported]`` / no GPUs probed)
    we can't classify, so we return ``[]`` rather than fabricate a verdict.

    ``torch_dtype`` is ``config.json``'s ``torch_dtype``; ``quant_method`` is
    ``quantization_config.quant_method`` (awq / gptq / fp8 / compressed-tensors
    / nvfp4 …) lower-cased by the caller-or-here. GGUF candidates have no such
    config — the caller passes ``torch_dtype="bfloat16"`` for them because
    GGUF is dequantized to fp16/bf16 at load (so capability-wise it behaves
    like a bf16 build, not like its on-disk INT quant).
