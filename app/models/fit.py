"""VRAM-fit math for the Add Model wizard (#85, parent #82).

Pure functions, no I/O. Given a model's ``config.json`` shape and a candidate
weights file size + selected GPU VRAM, predict whether the load will fit and
classify into a 4-way verdict. Used by ``POST /api/models/fit-preview`` and
mirrored client-side by dev-2 in #86 so the modal can colour-code rows live
on every checkbox tick.

The math derivation lives on issue #82; the thresholds (green<0.55,
yellow<0.80, orange<1.0, red>=1.0) and the KV-reserve formula are locked
there. This module is the single source of truth — drift here breaks the
contract test in ``tests/unit/models/test_fit.py``.

    The factor of 2 accounts for both K and V tensors. With the defaults
    (``head_dim=None``, ``sliding_layers=0``) this is byte-identical to the
    original ``bytes_per_token * max_model_len * max_batch_size``.

    ``head_dim`` is READ FROM THE CONFIG when the model declares one, and only
    derived as ``hidden_size // num_attention_heads`` when it does not. The two
    disagree in practice: gpt-oss-20b declares ``head_dim: 64`` while the
    derivation gives ``2880 // 64 = 45``, a 30% undercount of the whole KV
    term. Undercounting turns a red row green, which
    ``dtype_bytes_from_torch_dtype`` already names as the dangerous direction.

    ``sliding_layers`` / ``sliding_window`` describe interleaved sliding-window
    attention, where only some layers hold the full context and the rest hold a
    fixed window. Charging every layer the full context roughly doubles the
    estimate for gpt-oss-20b (12 of its 24 layers slide, with a 128-token
    window). The window is capped by ``max_model_len``: a window wider than the
    context reserves the context.

    Callers pass ``sliding_layers`` only from an EXPLICIT per-layer declaration
    (``config.layer_types``). Model families that imply sliding attention some
    other way keep today's all-full-attention estimate, which over-counts —
    the safe direction — rather than inviting a per-family heuristic that would
    silently under-count whenever it guessed wrong.
