"""In-process live request registry (Plane B).

Owner: dev-2. See docs/live-stats-spec.md § "Plane B".

Tracks every in-flight /v1 proxy request with token name, client IP, model,
context tokens (prompt + streamed completion) vs max_model_len, elapsed, phase
(prefill/decode), and an orphan flag (client disconnected but forward still
draining). Single uvicorn worker; lock-light — a short ``asyncio.Lock`` guards
insert/delete only, field updates during streaming are plain attribute writes
directly on the ``LiveRequest`` the caller holds (last-write-wins tolerated by
the reader, same rationale as ``ActiveRequestCounter.count()``). Absorbs
ActiveRequestCounter's ``count()`` so ``GET /api/admin/active-requests`` and its
Playwright test stay green.

Registration must be FAIL-OPEN: no registry error may ever break a proxied
request — every hook call in ``app/proxy/routes.py`` wraps this in try/except.
