"""HF tokenizer cache used by the proxy for prompt/completion accounting.

The cache grows by one entry per distinct (hf_repo, trust_remote_code) tuple
the proxy has been asked to count tokens for. Each entry holds a fully
loaded ``AutoTokenizer`` (vocab + merges + special-tokens config), which
runs anywhere from ~1 MiB (small word-piece tokenizers) to ~20+ MiB
(sentencepiece + BPE merges for some Qwen/Llama variants) of process RSS.

S7 (#124) — code-review finding #5: the cache was previously **never**
flushed on model unload. A long-lived warden that loads-and-unloads a
rotating set of models (operator iterating on tuning, or a CI-style
"smoke every catalog entry" workflow) would accumulate one entry per
distinct repo ever seen — eventually OOMing the process. The fix is
``evict(hf_repo)``, called from ``unload`` in the supervisor's unload
hook (see app/models/routes_api.py::unload_model). Same hf_repo loaded
again later transparently re-fetches.

The cache is per-(hf_repo, trust_remote_code) on purpose: the same repo
with and without ``trust_remote_code`` produces different tokenizer
classes (custom code is loaded only with the flag set), so they must
not share an entry. Evict by repo only — both variants for the same
hf_repo go at the same time.
