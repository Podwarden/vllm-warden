"""Live engine-metrics SSE — ``GET /api/stats/live`` (Plane A).

Scrapes EVERY loaded model's engine ``/metrics`` endpoint (aggregate Prometheus
text) and emits a parsed JSON frame over SSE, mirroring the header-metrics SSE
in ``app/header/routes_api.py`` (ticket auth, ``sse_headers``, ~2s cadence, 15s
keepalive, shared TTL cache so multi-tab collapses to one scrape).

FRAME SHAPE. ``{...leading model's block, "models": [block, ...]}`` — one block
per loaded model, each exactly what ``build_frame`` has always produced, plus
the leading block spread at the top level for a UI bundle older than the
``models`` key. ``build_frame`` itself is untouched and stays pinned by
tests/fixtures/live_frame_golden.json: eleven dashboard panels read it field by
field, so multi-model support had to be a wrapper around that shape rather than
a change to it.

WHICH models a viewer sees is the CLIENT's choice. Filtering here would put a
selection into the SSE ticket path, so every checkbox click would tear down and
re-mint the stream, and the frame already carries the per-model data — there is
nothing to gain by moving the choice to the server. Combining several blocks
into one number is likewise the client's job, and the ``| None`` contract below
is what makes that safe to do.

Two data planes back the live-stats dashboard (see docs/live-stats-spec.md).
This module is Plane A: the *aggregate* engine truth the engine exposes on
``127.0.0.1:{engine_port}/metrics``. Per-request KV/context truth is Plane B
(``app/stats/live_requests.py``), a separate module — they never share a file.

Design notes:

* **Dialect** — this module names **no engine metric at all**. Sub-project C
  moved the metric NAMES into each backend (``app/runtime/backends/*/metrics.py``)
  and the shared Prometheus text parser into ``app/stats/prometheus.py``. What
  arrives here is an ``EngineReading``: one field per concept, every field
  ``float | None``, where ``None`` means *this engine does not report it* — never
  zero. That is what lets llama.cpp, which publishes no KV gauge, no preemption
  counter and no latency histograms, degrade instead of lying.
* **Cache** — ``_MetricsCache`` keyed on ``model_id`` with a ~1.5s TTL and a
  single ``asyncio.Lock`` collapses N concurrent tabs to one scrape, mirroring
  ``_ProbeCache`` in ``app/system/routes_gpus.py``. The cached entry carries the
  scrape's monotonic timestamp so every tab derives per-second rates against a
  consistent clock.
* **Rates** — counters are cumulative; per-second rates (generation/prompt
  tokens, preemptions) and the interval prefix-cache hit rate are deltas vs the
  *connection's* previous frame. The first frame emits ``null`` rates. A counter
  going backwards (engine restart) also yields ``null`` for that tick.
* **Percentiles** — histogram p50/p90/p99 via cumulative ``_bucket`` count
  interpolation; means via ``_sum`` / ``_count``.
* **Fail-open** — a scrape failure is caught and surfaced as ``scrape_error`` on
  an otherwise-null frame; it never kills the stream (mirrors the header SSE).

    have produced a rate for whichever model happened to come second that was
    computed against the first model's totals -- a plausible-looking number
    with no meaning at all.
