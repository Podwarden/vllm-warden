"""Server-side history for the stats page.

The stats page kept no history anywhere: sparklines were roughly 80 seconds of
client-side React state that unmounted on navigation, rates were per-SSE-
connection deltas so every reconnect punched a hole, and a completed request was
erased from the registry in the streaming ``finally`` — discarding its duration,
TTFT and finish reason at the exact moment they became knowable. The result was
a dashboard that went blank precisely when something interesting had just
happened.

Everything in this module is free of engine, DB and HTTP imports. Retention is
the part that has to be right, and it is much easier to be sure of when it can
be tested without any of them.

Memory is bounded by construction. The warden runs a single uvicorn worker (see
``app/proxy/scheduler.py``), so process-local rings are sufficient; if that ever
changes these become the first thing that needs a shared store.

Completed requests used to live here too, in a ``FinishedRing`` (200 rows, 15
minutes, gone with the process). They are persisted now -- see
``app/stats/request_history.py`` -- because a per-request history that dies
with the process could answer neither "what happened today" nor "what is this
model's TTFT distribution".
