    ``models`` is a comma-separated list of model ids. Absent means the whole
    deployment (the original behaviour, byte-for-byte). Present, it narrows
    EVERY number in the response -- see ``_parse_models``.

    WHAT "NARROWS" MEANS PER SERIES, because the three data sources carry
    different dimensions and pretending otherwise would produce a chart that
    silently answers a different question than its checkboxes:

      tokens / tps   per MODEL. ``model_samples`` has a model_id column, so the
                     filter is exact and a selection is a true partition:
                     selecting every model sums to the unfiltered total.
      vram / util /  per CARD. Those tables have no model column at all, so the
      power          selection is resolved to the union of the selected models'
                     ``gpu_indices`` and the cards are filtered by that. "This
                     model's VRAM" is, and can only be, "the VRAM of the cards
                     it occupies" -- which is also the number an operator asking
                     "will another model fit beside it" needs.

    A selected model holding no cards contributes none, so a selection of only
    such rows yields empty GPU series rather than silently widening to the box.

    NOTE ON THE TOKEN SOURCE. The tokens series and ``tps`` come from
    ``model_samples``, not ``token_usage_minute``. They were the latter, which
    is keyed by API token and has no model dimension -- so it cannot be filtered
    by model at all, and using it for the unfiltered case while using
    ``model_samples`` for the filtered one would make "every model selected"
    disagree with "no filter". One source keeps the selection a partition. The
    numbers move slightly: ``model_samples`` also counts requests made without
    an API token, which ``token_usage_minute`` deliberately skips so the NULL
    key does not accumulate orphan rows. ``/api/stats/v2/tokens-per-key`` still
    reads ``token_usage_minute`` -- that endpoint asks a per-key question, which
    is the one that table answers.
