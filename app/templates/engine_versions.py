"""Resolve a channel → the published vLLM versions that map to a real image.

The try-stack panel (#177) lets an operator pick a ``(channel, vllm_version)``
combo. The version field was free-text; this module backs it with the actual
``vllm/vllm-openai`` semver tags published on Docker Hub so the dropdown only
offers versions that will resolve to an image (``app/templates/resolver.py``).

Three concerns live here, deliberately separated so the network layer is the
only thing tests need to stub:

  - ``resolve_family``: ``channel`` → image family (reuses the resolver's
    ``_RESOLVABLE`` map). Non-resolvable channels return ``None``.
  - ``filter_sort_dedupe_tags``: pure tag-name → version-string transform
    (keep ``^v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$``, strip ``v``, semver-desc, dedupe).
  - ``fetch_docker_hub_tags`` + ``EngineVersionsCache``: the bounded,
    paginated Docker Hub query and a 6h in-process TTL cache keyed by image
    family. Docker Hub rate-limits anonymous tag queries hard, so we never
    hit it per request, and serve stale-on-error rather than 500 the page.
