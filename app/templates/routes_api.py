"""HTTP routes for the engine-version dropdown (#177).

Single read-only endpoint: ``GET /api/templates/engine-versions?channel=...``.
Backs the try-stack panel's vLLM-version field with the published
``vllm/vllm-openai`` semver tags that actually resolve to an image.

The channel → image family map (``app/templates/resolver.py``) decides
resolvability: every CUDA channel → ``vllm/vllm-openai``; rocm/cpu/xpu/unknown
have no upstream tag scheme today and return an empty list (they already 400
on try-stack, so the dropdown simply offers nothing). Docker Hub's anonymous
tag listing is rate-limited hard, so the versions come from a 6h in-process
TTL cache keyed by image family — never a per-request fetch — and a Docker Hub
hiccup serves stale-or-empty rather than 500ing the page.
