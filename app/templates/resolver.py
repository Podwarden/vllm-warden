"""Channel + vLLM version → engine container image (the #161-minimal map).

A template's engine axis is ``(channel, vllm_version)``; a driver needs a
concrete image. This module is the single place that mapping lives.

Scope (locked decisions D1/D4): the only path exercised end-to-end is CUDA
via the **upstream** ``vllm/vllm-openai`` tags. We deliberately do NOT
fabricate tag schemes for rocm/cpu/xpu — those channels are *known* (so the
UI can list them and reject early) but resolving one raises rather than
emitting an unverified tag. Patched per-channel images are #161-full, later.
