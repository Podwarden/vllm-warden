"""Live header metrics SSE: ``GET /api/header/metrics/stream``.

Powers the compact VRAM% + GPU% + active-model badge mounted in the nav
chrome (frontend/src/components/header-metrics.tsx). Emits one JSON event
every ``VW_HEADER_METRICS_INTERVAL_S`` seconds (default 2.0).

The payload is intentionally a small superset of what the badge renders
today so future iterations (e.g. tooltip with per-GPU breakdown) don't
need a new endpoint::

    }

Auth: SSE ticket (same pattern as model log streams). The widget is
hidden on /login and /setup on the client; this endpoint stays JWT-gated
via ticket mint so the contract is symmetric — no GPU info leaks to
unauthenticated callers.

Data source: shares ``app.state.gpu_probe_cache`` with
``/api/system/gpus`` (2s TTL absorbs burst polling so multiple tabs
collapse to one ``nvidia-smi`` invocation). Active-model lookup joins
``models`` to ``model_runtime``: a ``status='loaded'`` row surfaces only
with a runtime sibling, while ``loading`` and ``failed`` rows surface
without one (they have none yet) so the badge can read "loading" or go
red on a crash instead of claiming "idle". See ``_active_models``.

    status)``, most significant first. Empty list when the box is idle.

    This was ``_active_model``, singular, ending in ``LIMIT 1`` under a comment
    reading "the supervisor enforces single-model loading, so multiple
    ``loaded`` rows would be a defect we don't paper over here". That is no
    longer the product. The operator serves a vLLM model on one card and a
    llama.cpp model on the other, simultaneously, and the header named exactly
    one of them. The LIMIT was not a display choice -- it was a single-model
    assumption compiled into SQL, so no amount of frontend work could have
    shown the second engine.

    Three states qualify, and they are NOT symmetric:

    - ``loaded`` — requires a ``model_runtime`` sibling. That row is what
      proves the supervisor actually owns a live engine; a ``loaded`` row
      without one is stale state we must not advertise as serving.
    - ``loading`` — has NO ``model_runtime`` sibling yet, because the
      supervisor writes that only once the engine answers. Surfacing it is
      the whole point: a 27B load takes minutes, and reporting "idle" for
      that window tells the operator the opposite of what is happening.
    - ``failed`` — also has no sibling. This is the state that matters most
      and used to be the most invisible: after an engine death the row sits
      in ``failed`` indefinitely (nothing auto-restores it), and a header
      reading "idle" was indistinguishable from a clean, healthy box.

    Hence the LEFT JOIN plus an explicit per-status predicate rather than a
    plain INNER JOIN — the strictness is kept exactly where it matters.

    Precedence is ``loaded`` > ``loading`` > ``failed``, so a live engine is
    never repainted by an unrelated stale failure and an operator's retry
    (``failed`` -> ``loading``) is visibly acknowledged. With several rows that
    precedence stops being a filter and becomes an ORDER: everything is
    reported, and the leading entry is the one the legacy singular fields name.

    The within-class tiebreak is ``served_model_name``, NOT ``updated_at``. The
    badge repaints every two seconds; ``updated_at`` moves under a running
    fleet, so ordering by it would visibly reshuffle a multi-model header
    whenever a row was merely touched. A name is stable, and it also makes the
    chip order match the order the operator reads elsewhere.
