// What warrants pinning down here is not the markup, it is the promises the
// design makes about this UI:
//
//   * the acknowledgement is an explicit choice, and the POST body carries it
//   * no mode is presented as crash-free
//   * progress is POLLED, and an indeterminate bar omits aria-valuenow
//   * the result LEADS with a setting, marks recommended_config as not-live,
//     and never shows a limit as a single scalar
//   * a failure says WHICH failure, because the remedies differ
//   * closing resets, so the next open is a fresh confirm screen
//
// Fetch is stubbed globally so the auth-fetch wrapper runs end to end,
// mirroring delete-model-modal.test.tsx.
//

// NO WALL CLOCK ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE.

// This suite has failed twice in CI on a contended runner, both times on an
// assertion whose correctness depended on how much real time had passed, and
// both times it was retried green rather than investigated. Neither failure
// was a defect in the component.
//
// Every wait here is therefore expressed as "yield until the thing I already
// know has started has finished", with an ITERATION ceiling and no time
// budget. `waitFor` and `findBy*` are deliberately absent: their 1 s
// real-timer budget is the wrong instrument for that question, because a
// descheduled worker expires the budget without the work ever being late.
//
// The mirror hazard is just as real and is what bit the second time: an
// assertion is also unsound when the state it names is only true for a
// BOUNDED window of real time. Fixtures here therefore hold a state open
// until the test has finished looking at it, rather than letting the next
// poll take it away. See the transient-poll-failure test.

/**
 * Yield the event loop once and flush React's response to whatever settled.
 *
 * The point is what it does NOT have: a deadline. `waitFor` gives up after a
 * budget of real time, which is the wrong instrument for "the work I already
 * know has started has finished" — a descheduled CI worker expires that budget
 * without the work ever having been late. A `setTimeout(0)` drains the pending
 * microtasks (fetch → Response → json → setState) and the `act` flush commits
 * the render; a stalled process merely arrives at it later.
 *
 * Note the shape: the yield is OUTSIDE `act`, and the flush is `act`'s
 * SYNCHRONOUS form. The obvious `await act(async () => { await sleep(0) })`
 * looks equivalent and is not — its async form refuses to resolve until it
 * observes an empty act queue, and this modal refills that queue on every
 * turn of the loop as soon as its poll timer is chronically overdue, which is
 * the normal condition on a contended runner with a 5 ms interval. Measured:
 * with every poll retry late, the async form never returns and the test dies
 * on the runner's own timeout after 60 s; this form passes with each poll
 * 2000 ms late, just slower. The synchronous flush drains what is queued now
 * and returns, so it is bounded by construction. Updates that land during the
 * unwrapped yield are picked up by the very next flush, and React emits no
 * act warning for them (verified: zero across the file).

  // runner is not the test's to spend. That host carried three other jobs
  // (every phase 2-3x the green runs -- environment 140 s vs 47 s), the worker
  // was descheduled for seconds, and the budget expired while the successful
  // poll was still sitting in the timer queue. Anchoring on the poll and
  // yielding with `settle()` fixed that half, and it has held.
  //
  // Second failure: the ARRIVAL half, on a 503 that the fixture served to
  // exactly ONE poll. That made the banner true for exactly one poll interval
  // — 5 ms here — and put the assertion in a race against the modal's own
  // recovery. Measured: a deschedule of 5 ms or more between the failing poll
  // scheduling its retry and the timer phase running is enough for the
  // RECOVERY poll to fire inside the same `settle()`, so the banner arrives
  // and is wiped before the assertion ever reads it. That is a 5 ms
  // wall-clock deadline hidden in the fixture — two orders of magnitude
  // tighter than the 1 s budget the first fix removed, and hardening the wait
