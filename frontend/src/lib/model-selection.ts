// picks once and every surface answers about the same models. A per-page
// selection would let two pages disagree about what "the numbers" mean while
// both were open, which is the same defect as a control whose effect is gated
// on something other than the control.
//
// THE RULE THAT SHAPES THIS FILE: at least one model stays selected. An empty
// selection has two plausible readings — "everything" and "nothing" — and
// every surface downstream would have to pick one. So the state can never
// reach it: the last remaining checkbox is DISABLED rather than silently
// re-ticked. Silently re-selecting would mean the operator clicks, sees the box
// stay ticked, and cannot tell whether the click registered.
//
// The pure functions are separate from the hook so the rule can be tested
// without a DOM, a clock, or localStorage.
