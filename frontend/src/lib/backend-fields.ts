// Which model fields each backend actually consumes.
//
// This table used to live inside `app/models/[id]/settings/page.tsx` and was
// applied on that page alone. The detail page rendered the same row's fields
// unconditionally, so a llama.cpp model advertised a `Tensor parallel size` and
// a `gpu_memory_utilization` -- two vLLM-only concepts -- next to an `Engine`
// label. One table, one rule, both pages: a second copy is how the two drift.
//
// Hide, do not disable. A greyed-out box for a knob the engine has never heard
// of is an invitation to wonder what it does; the field is not "unavailable",
// it is meaningless (design spec §9.1, UI audit §4.5).
//
// The source of truth is `BackendCapabilities`, served on
// `/api/system/backends`; this map is the rendering half of it. A field named
// for NO backend here is shared and always shown -- that is the common case,
// and it is why the map lists only the exceptions.
//
// `parallelism_strategy` is deliberately absent from both lists: the control is
// create-time only, and if it ever reaches a detail or settings surface it must
// not be offered for llama.cpp -- plan() maps both 'tp' and 'pp' to
// --split-mode layer, so the question has no answer there.

// The same rule, one level up: whole PANELS a backend has no concept of.

// The Try-stack panel picks a CUDA channel and a vLLM version. Both are vLLM's

// llama.cpp counterpart -- so on a llama.cpp row the panel was not merely
// offering an unavailable control, it was offering one that could only ever
// resolve a *vLLM* image and launch vLLM under the operator's llama.cpp model
// name.
//
// That is the field rule at panel scale, so it lives in this file rather than
// in a second gate somewhere else. What differs is where the answer comes from:
// a field's owner is a static fact about the engine and is listed above, while
// "can a version be pinned here" is a fact about the engine AND the running
// driver, which only the server knows. So the server sends the decision
// (`version_pin_reason_code` on GET /api/system/backends) and this function
// turns it into the one thing the client has to choose between.
