// SSE connection state machine — v2026.05.15.2 hardening
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The previous useEventSource silently exp-backoff'd forever on every error,
// which meant a 404 or 403 from the backend looked indistinguishable from a
// transient network blip in the UI: the spinner just kept spinning. The
// EventSource API itself only exposes a generic `error` event with no HTTP
// status, so we can't tell terminal-from-transient by looking at the SSE
// connection alone.
//
// The fix: before each connect attempt we mint the SSE ticket via
// `POST /api/auth/sse-ticket`. That request DOES surface a real HTTP status,
// and serves as a HEAD-ish probe for the path itself (the backend rejects
// the ticket mint if the caller has no access to the underlying stream).
// We use the ticket-mint status to classify:
//
//   * 4xx (except 429) → terminal-error  — the operator needs to act
//     (re-login, or the stream genuinely doesn't exist). Stop reconnecting.
//   * 5xx, network, 429, or EventSource onerror after at least one onopen →
//     reconnecting with exp backoff, capped at MAX_RECONNECT attempts so
//     a broken backend doesn't pin the tab to retry forever.
//
// State is surfaced via the hook's return value so consumers (e.g.
// log-stream.tsx) can render distinct UI: "connecting…", "live", "lost,
// retrying (N/5)", "stream unavailable — please re-login or refresh".
