// Dual-mode "stick to bottom / free scroll" helper for streaming lists.
//
// Used by:
//   - models/log-stream.tsx       (v17.11 #75 — vLLM stdout/stderr tail)
//
// Originally also driven the bench/events-tab tail; that consumer was
// removed in epic/overhaul S1. The hook stays in `shared/` because the
// same semantics will be needed by future streaming views (e.g. system
// messages, gpu_samples replay).
//
// The hook is deliberately tiny and unaware of the underlying list — it
// just exposes the mode + the two callbacks the consumer wires into
// react-virtuoso's `followOutput` and `atBottomStateChange`. Doing it
// this way means the hook works equally well with a plain scroll
// container (LogStream needs that for the elided-marker overlay) and
// with Virtuoso's tracker.

   * makes Virtuoso emit a steady stream of transient `atBottom=false` —
   * the exact signal that used to permanently unstick the tail back when
   * `followOutput` was gated on `mode` (`false` while "free"). The latch
