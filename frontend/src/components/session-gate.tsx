// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Before this gate, a signed-out visitor opening /ui/ saw the Models page —
// heading, skeleton cards, the lot — for the length of one round trip, and was
// then bounced to /ui/login. The first impression of the product was a page
// that flashed empty and threw the visitor out; "it's broken" is a fair
// reading of that.
//
// The cause is ordering, not auth: the shell renders immediately, and the
// session is only discovered later by whichever SWR fetcher gets a 401 first.
// So resolve it up front instead. `ensureSession()` performs the one
// `POST /api/auth/refresh` that `authFetch`'s eager-refresh guard was going to
// make anyway before its first request, and `refresh()` de-dupes concurrent
// callers — so this costs no extra network, it just moves a decision earlier.
//
// Three outcomes:
//   'ok'        — render the shell.
//   'transient' — render the shell anyway. The backend is restarting or the
//                 link flapped; the cookie was never rejected. Wedging the
//                 whole UI behind a spinner during a backend bounce would be
//                 a worse failure than the one being fixed, and each page's
//                 own error handling is already written for this.
//   'invalid'   — the session really is dead. Redirect and stay closed, so
//                 nothing behind the gate ever paints.
//
// /login and the /setup/* wizard render unconditionally: they are the pages
// you reach WITHOUT a session, and gating them would deadlock the product on
// first run. The route list mirrors `isUnauthRoute` in nav-bar.tsx — the same
// question ("is this page for someone not signed in?") asked by the two
// components that both have to know the answer.
