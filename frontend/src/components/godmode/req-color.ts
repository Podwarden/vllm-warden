// Per-request color derivation for the god-mode viewer.
//
// God mode interleaves the token streams of many concurrent requests. To
// let an operator track one session by eye through that interleaving, every
// request (`req_id`) gets a STABLE, deterministic color applied to its block
// header + left-edge accent bar. This is display-only — the backend never
// sends a color; it's derived here so there is zero server state.
//
// Two derivation paths:
//   - golden-angle (preferred): keyed on a per-session request index, so
//     adjacent requests land ~137.5° apart on the hue wheel and are always
//     visually distinct. The viewer assigns each new req_id a monotonic
//     session index (never reclaimed), so a request's color is stable for
//     the life of the session even as older events are elided from the ring.
//   - hash fallback: FNV-1a over the req_id → hue, used when no index is
//     available (e.g. a request whose start was elided before we saw it).
//
// Saturation/lightness are fixed at mid values that stay legible on both the
// light and dark themes: the accent is a solid mid-L/mid-S hue that has
// enough contrast against slate-950 and against white, and the header tint is
// alpha-blended so it composits over whichever theme background is behind it.
