"""Shared pytest fixtures.

S5 (#104): the fixture ordering here intentionally seeds the DB BEFORE the
FastAPI TestClient's lifespan opens an aiosqlite connection. The original
shape (test calls ``client.get("/healthz")`` then ``_seed_done(...)``) raced
with the lifespan's WAL-mode aiosqlite connection: the sync sqlite3.connect
in ``_seed_done`` opens its own connection on a DB file that the async
connection already holds a WAL writer on. The fix is to ensure migrations
run, the lifespan releases its DB connection back to the pool, and seeding
happens via the SAME aiosqlite path the app uses — no more sync/async mix.

S2 (#55): a second, related flake — nondeterministic 401 "invalid
credentials" on the first POST /api/auth/login — is mitigated at the
SQLite level by ``seed_admin_user`` (matching PRAGMAs + explicit
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` + ``wal_checkpoint(FULL)``). ``jwt_login`` adds a
bounded retry-on-401 as defence-in-depth: with #104's checkpoint fix the
retry rarely fires, but it covers any residual aiosqlite read-after-write
window AND any future transient 401 not caused by seeding (route-handler
scheduling, token-cache warm-up, etc.) without papering over real bugs
(non-401 responses surface immediately).

# Hermetic Hugging Face: ``TokenizerCache.get`` calls

# on a developer machine, also picks up whatever happens to be in
# ``~/.cache/huggingface``. Measured on tests/unit/proxy/test_proxy_route.py:
# 13.1 s online vs 7.6 s offline, and on a cold CI container it is a real
# download per run. Offline mode + an empty HF_HOME makes the load fail
# immediately, which is the code path the cache already handles by falling
# back to a character estimate (see app/proxy/tokenizers.py::count). Tests
# that need a real tokenizer stub ``app.state.tokenizers``.
#
# Both variables are read by ``huggingface_hub.constants`` at import time, so
# they must be set here, before anything imports transformers, not in a
# fixture. ``setdefault`` so an operator can still opt back in explicitly.

# Two fixed costs dominated the unit suite (measured 2026-09-03, 2035 tests,
# 367.6 s serial on an M-series Mac before / 60.6 s after):
#
#   * bcrypt at the production cost factor. ``bcrypt.gensalt()`` defaults to
#     12 rounds (~370 ms/op on an M-series Mac, more on the CI runners). The
#     suite performs ~640 hashpw+checkpw calls per run — every
#     ``seed_admin_user`` hashes and every ``jwt_login`` verifies — which was
#     ~240 s of those 367.6 s. Nothing in the tree asserts on
#     the cost factor; the hash format, the verify path and the production
#     code are all unchanged. ``_fast_bcrypt`` lowers the DEFAULT rounds to
#     bcrypt's minimum (4) for the duration of each test by patching the
#     module attribute every call site resolves at call time. Production
#     defaults are untouched.
#
#   * Running all 28 schema migrations against a fresh SQLite file inside
#     every ``client`` lifespan (28 ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``/``COMMIT`` pairs, each
#     an fsync). ``migrated_db_template`` runs them ONCE per session through
#     the exact same ``open_db`` + ``apply_migrations`` path and the ``client``
#     fixture ``shutil.copyfile``s the result into the test's data dir. The
#     lifespan still calls ``apply_migrations`` on it, sees every file already
#     recorded in ``schema_migrations`` and applies nothing. A test that
#     genuinely needs to observe migrations being applied by the lifespan
#     opts out with ``@pytest.mark.fresh_db``.
