"""A fake OpenAI-compatible engine, with a knob for every outcome class.

This started as a two-endpoint stub for the proxy integration tests. The stress
harness needs much more from it: the whole point of that design is that the
seven outcome classes, the crash/recover path and the wedge path are all
testable **with no GPU**, and the only way that is true is if a fake engine can
be told to produce each of them on demand and deterministically.

Two rules govern what is faked here.

**The shapes are recorded, not invented.** ``tests/fixtures/stress/llamacpp_recorded.json``
holds verbatim captures from llama-server b10731, and the error envelope, the
usage frame and the unknown-model behaviour below are copied from it rather
than guessed. In particular:

* a context refusal is ``error.type = "exceed_context_size_error"`` with exact
  ``n_prompt_tokens``/``n_ctx``, which is *structured* evidence a classifier can
  act on without parsing prose;
* usage arrives in a **final frame whose ``choices`` array is empty**, carrying
  ``prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens``;
* an **unknown model name is not an error** — it returns 200 with empty content
  and ``finish_reason: "length"``. That is the nastiest trap in the whole
  feature, because it trips the REASONING_ONLY and ABRUPT gates and so publishes
  a harness bug as model degradation. It is on by default here precisely so a
  harness that forgets to send the real ``served_model_name`` fails its own
  tests.

**The engine answers the probes correctly when it is healthy.** A fake that
returned canned text would make every graded probe WRONG, every outcome
DEGRADED, and every end-to-end runner test vacuous. :func:`_answer` therefore
understands the six probes in ``app/stress/probes.py`` and answers them, so PASS
is reachable and a degradation knob means something.

Knobs resolve in three layers, widest first: environment (``VW_FAKE_*``, for the
subprocess form), the app's mutable knob object (``POST /_fake/knobs`` or
``FakeEngine.set``), then per-request query parameters. The last is what lets one
server serve a healthy probe and a refusing probe in the same test.
