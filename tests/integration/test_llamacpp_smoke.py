    llama.cpp's own CI images ship an ELF RUNPATH of '/app/build/bin:' -- a
    leftover build-tree path whose empty trailing element resolves against the
    CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY. That works only because their image sets
    WORKDIR /app. Our engine is launched by a supervisor with a different cwd,
    so we set an rpath at build time instead. If that were ever lost,
    llama-server would die with 'error while loading shared libraries' from some
    directories and work from others -- the worst kind of bug.

    BOTH PATHS, and that is the point of the parametrisation. argv[0] is the
    bare name `llama-server`, so PATH resolves it to a SYMLINK. An exec of the
    symlink works on `$ORIGIN` alone -- the kernel sets /proc/self/exe to the
    real path -- but ``ldd`` expands $ORIGIN from the path it is GIVEN and
    reports "not found" through the symlink. The rpath therefore carries the
    absolute directory too, so the tool and the runtime agree; testing only the
    real path would have missed exactly that.
