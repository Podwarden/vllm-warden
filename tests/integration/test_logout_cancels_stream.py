"""End-to-end test: POST /api/auth/logout cancels any active SSE streams
owned by the same user.

This stitches together the three moving parts that earlier unit tests cover
in isolation:

  * `app.auth.routes.logout` calls `app.state.stream_registry.cancel_user(...)`.
  * The SSE handler in `app.models.routes_logs.stream_logs` registers
    `asyncio.current_task()` on first iteration and unregisters in `finally`.
  * `StreamRegistry.cancel_user` calls `Task.cancel()` on every active task.

Run everything inside one event loop via `httpx.AsyncClient` +
`ASGITransport(app)` so that:

  * The streaming generator's `asyncio.current_task()` is a real Task on the
    same loop that the logout request runs on — `.cancel()` is well-defined
    (no cross-loop hazard like the one we hit in Task 1.7 with the sync
    TestClient).
  * Both requests share `app.state`, so the registry state is observable.
