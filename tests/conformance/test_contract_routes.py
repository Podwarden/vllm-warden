"""Every route the package contract names must exist on this backend.

The static half of the conformance story: the shipped OpenAPI slice
(`dist/contract/openapi.chat.json`) is the route map, so a path or method
that has drifted out of `app/` shows up here in the ordinary unit run —
long before the vitest kit gets a chance to fail against a live server.
Skips when the npm package is not installed (`npm ci` in `frontend/`).
