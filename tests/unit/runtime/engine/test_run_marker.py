"""Run-boundary sentinels scope engine-log diagnosis to the CURRENT run (#234).

The engine log is append-only across load attempts, so before this the
200-line diagnosis window straddled runs: a previous attempt's recognised
traceback (OOM / KV overflow) was matched and reported as the cause of the
current attempt, replacing the accurate generic message. Observed twice live
on 2026-09-03 -- once a run that got all the way through profiling
(``Available KV cache memory: 2.31 GiB``, ``init engine ... took 123.13 s``)
was reported as "GPU ran out of memory loading the model".

The fixtures below are shaped exactly like that incident: run 1 fails with a
pattern the parser recognises, run 2 does not contain it. The parser must see
only run 2.
