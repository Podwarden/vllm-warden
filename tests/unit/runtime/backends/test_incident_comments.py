"""Nine production incidents live as comments beside the code they explain.

Sub-project B relocates the three modules that carry them. Comments do not have
tests, so a "helpful" rewrite during the move would delete institutional memory
silently and nobody would notice until the incident recurred. This test pins
one stable marker per incident to the file that must contain it.

If a marker moves to a different file, update the table -- deliberately, in a
commit that says why. If a marker DISAPPEARS, the comment was deleted and the
change is wrong.
