"""llama.cpp's log grammar -> an actionable operator message.

Driven by the REAL logs Task 2 captured, not by paraphrase: a diagnoser tested
only against strings someone typed from memory passes forever and never fires in
production. Two of the cases below are the distinction that matters most, and it
is the same one app/runtime/backends/vllm/diagnostics.py draws for vLLM:

  * ``log_ctx_capped``  -- the requested context did not fit and llama.cpp said
    so. Lowering max_model_len IS the fix, so we say so and, where the log gives
    the capped number, hand it back as recommended_max_model_len.
  * ``log_oom``         -- the allocator failed while placing WEIGHTS or KV.
    Lowering max_model_len does NOT help; the answer is fewer offloaded layers,
    a smaller quant, or a bigger card. Suggesting a context reduction here sends
    the operator round a loop that cannot terminate.

Matching is on STABLE TOKENS, not exact phrasing -- llama.cpp's wording drifts
across builds, and these fixtures are one build.
