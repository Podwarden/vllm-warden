"""The characterisation corpus for sub-project B.

Sub-project B's defining property is that NOTHING changes. These 22 cases are
the mechanical proof: each is a model row + launch context that exercises one
branch of the vLLM argv/env builders. The exact argv and env they produce today
are frozen into ``tests/fixtures/launch_golden.json`` and re-asserted after
every refactor step.

Run ``python -m tests.unit.runtime.backends.corpus`` from the repo root to
REGENERATE the golden file. Regenerating is a deliberate act: the diff on
``launch_golden.json`` is the behaviour change, and it must be empty for every
task in this plan.

    """Stand-in for ``app.db.repos.models.ModelRow``.

    Deliberately a separate type, and deliberately NOT importing ModelRow: the

    columns added by migrations 0011/0014/0015/0022, and the corpus must keep
    exercising those defensive reads.

    WARNING -- THIS STUB IS CURRENTLY *MORE CAPABLE* THAN THE REAL ModelRow.
    ``quantization`` and ``max_num_seqs`` are real columns (migration 0011) but
    are absent from ``ModelRow``, ``_MODEL_COLS`` and ``_decode_row``, so on a
    production row ``getattr(model, "quantization", None)`` returns None and the
    flag is never emitted. Declaring them here means the ``quantization_set``
    and ``max_num_seqs_set`` cases below exercise a path production cannot
    currently reach. That divergence is deliberate and pinned by
    ``test_stub_mirrors_model_row`` -- do NOT quietly delete the fields, and do
    NOT quietly delete the test when the bug is fixed. See Task 1 Step 6

# The live-baseline cases. THESE THREE ARE NOT INVENTED.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each is a verbatim transcription of a model row that was serving in
# production on 2026-09-01, captured before the `bonus` wipe
# (~/llm-warden-baselines-2026-09-01/, committed here as
# tests/fixtures/live_baseline_argv.json).
#
# They matter for two different reasons:
#
#   1. COVERAGE. Only `bonus` is wiped and reinstalled; `home` is a production
#      dependency and is never touched, so there is no post-release `home` to
#      diff against. `home` is also the only install exercising the
#      tensor-parallel path (TP=4), the large-context path (262144) and an
#      fp8 KV cache. Transcribing its row keeps those argv branches covered
#      even though that install never runs the new build.
#   2. CORRECTNESS, which is the stronger of the two. Every other case in this
#      corpus is self-referential: the golden file records whatever the code
#      does, so it proves the refactor changed nothing -- not that the output
#      was ever right. These three have an EXTERNAL oracle: the argv a live
#      install actually produced. See test_live_baseline_oracle.py.
#
# Transcribe rows EXACTLY. A "tidied" value silently converts an oracle into
# another self-referential case.
