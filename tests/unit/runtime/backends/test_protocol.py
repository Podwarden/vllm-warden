"""The Backend interface's structural invariants.

The important test here is not that the dataclasses exist — it is
test_launch_plan_has_no_entrypoint_field and its sibling source scan. Spec §2
forbids runtime mutation (no patched image, no pre-start hook, no
sitecustomize / PYTHONPATH / LD_PRELOAD injection), and §6.3 chose to enforce
that STRUCTURALLY: a launch is argv + env and nothing else, so there is no
place in the type for a backend to mutate its own runtime. These tests are what
makes that structural rather than advisory.

    """``path``'s source with prose, and the hard-lock DECLARATION, removed.

    DEVIATION FROM THE PLAN AS WRITTEN, and it is load-bearing. The plan's
    version of the scan below read the raw file, which cannot work against the
    plan's own code: ``app/runtime/backends/__init__.py``'s module docstring
    says "There is deliberately no ``entrypoint`` field" (that sentence is the
    whole point of the invariant), and Task 9 adds the string literals
    ``"PYTHONPATH"`` and ``"LD_PRELOAD"`` to ``HARD_LOCKED_ENV_KEYS`` in
    ``backends/vllm/env.py`` -- i.e. *under* this directory. Taken literally,
    the guard fails on the very lines that enforce what it is guarding.

    So the scan runs over EXECUTABLE CODE only, and skips two things that name
    a forbidden token precisely in order to forbid it:

      * docstrings and comments -- prose explaining the ban is the invariant
        being written down where the code lives, which is the guard working;
      * the ``HARD_LOCKED_ENV_KEYS`` assignment -- a list of keys that may
        never be set is a declaration, not a use.

    Everything else still counts. A ``LaunchPlan.entrypoint`` field, an
    ``entrypoint=`` kwarg, or ``env["PYTHONPATH"] = ...`` anywhere under
    ``app/runtime/backends/`` fails this test, which is the behaviour the
    constraint actually asks for.

    Known, accepted narrowness: comments are stripped by splitting on the
    first ``#``, so a forbidden token appearing AFTER a ``#`` inside a string
    literal would be missed. Nothing legitimate looks like that, and the
    alternative (full tokenisation) buys no real coverage.
