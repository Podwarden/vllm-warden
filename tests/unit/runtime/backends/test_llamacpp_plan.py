"""LlamaCppBackend.plan() -- argv and env, pinned before they are written.

The golden file is the llama.cpp analogue of B's tests/fixtures/launch_golden.json.
It is hand-written FIRST from the flag table in the plan, then the implementation
is written until it matches -- so the argv is a decision that was reviewed, not
an artefact of whatever the code happened to emit.

Every flag spelling in the golden is checked against
tests/fixtures/llamacpp/help.txt (Task 2's real --help capture) by
test_every_flag_exists_in_the_captured_help, which is what stops this file from
freezing a flag that llama.cpp does not have.
