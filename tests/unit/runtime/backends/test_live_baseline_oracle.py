"""The only test in this suite with an EXTERNAL oracle.

Every other characterisation test is self-referential: the golden file records
whatever the code currently does, which proves a refactor changed nothing but
never proves the output was right. These three cases compare the builder's
output against argv that two live production installs actually produced on
2026-09-01.

`home` matters most and is the reason this file exists. Only `bonus` is wiped
and reinstalled -- `home` is a production dependency (15 API tokens, four in
active use) and is never touched -- so there is no post-release `home` to diff
against. It is also the only install with TP=4, a 262144 context and an fp8 KV
cache. This test is how those argv branches stay covered.

A failure here is NOT a golden-file regeneration. It means the builder no
longer reproduces what production ran.
