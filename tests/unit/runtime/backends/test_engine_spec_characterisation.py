"""Prove the LAUNCH SEQUENCE, not just the two builders.

Supervisor.load reads the HF token off disk, calls build_subprocess_env and
build_vllm_args, resolves the engine-image pin, and assembles an EngineSpec
that it hands to the driver. This test captures that whole assembly with a fake
driver, so a refactor that gets both builders right but wires them together
differently still fails.
