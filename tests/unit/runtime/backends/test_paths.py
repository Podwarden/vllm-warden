"""Turning an HF repo id into the absolute files llama.cpp needs.

The layout under test is the one huggingface_hub's snapshot_download writes and
app/chat2/catalog.py:53-69 already walks:

    <root>/models--org--name/snapshots/<revision-sha>/<filename>

with the snapshot entries being symlinks into ../../blobs/. Two wrinkles are
real and are tested here because both were observed on the live host:

* The revision on the model row is a REF ('main'), not the snapshot's SHA
  directory name. We resolve by newest-first directory scan, the same way
  read_hf_config does, rather than by trusting the ref.
* The same repo can exist under BOTH <root>/models--... and
  <root>/hub/models--... . On bonus on 2026-09-01 there were two complete,
  non-hardlinked copies of models--ISTA-DASLab--Qwen3.8-27B-3Bit-GSQ, 11.85 GB
  each, because the pull task passes cache_dir=<root> while anything using
  huggingface_hub's own defaults writes to <root>/hub. Resolving only one of
  them would make a model that is plainly on disk look missing.
