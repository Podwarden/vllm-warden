    `max_num_seqs` are real columns (migration 0011) that ModelRow, _MODEL_COLS
    and _decode_row never learned about, so a production row has no such
    attribute and cmd_builder's getattr(..., None) silently drops the flag.

    WHEN THAT BUG IS FIXED, THIS TEST FAILS -- and the fix is to delete the
    name from KNOWN_DIVERGENCES, not to widen the exception. That is the point:
    the corpus should find out.

    Any OTHER divergence is a bug in the corpus and must be fixed here.
