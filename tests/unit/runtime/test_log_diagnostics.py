"""Unit tests for the engine-log diagnostic parser.

``diagnose_engine_log`` scans an engine-log tail and turns a raw vLLM crash
traceback into an actionable, operator-facing message. It matches on STABLE
tokens (not exact phrasing) because vLLM's wording drifts across versions.
Returns ``None`` when nothing matches so the caller keeps its generic message.

The two KV-related fixtures below are the EXACT strings observed in production (real
vLLM output), including their quirks (``models's`` typo, a stray ``(`` before
``16.0 GiB``). The parser must match these tolerantly — never anchor on exact
punctuation.
