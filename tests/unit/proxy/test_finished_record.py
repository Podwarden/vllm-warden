"""The finished-request record's identity fields.

``model_id`` is what every stats endpoint filters on, and callers supply the
models table's row id there -- ``/api/stats/v2/overview`` validates exactly
that (``_resolve_selection``). The finished ring was being written with the
SERVED model name under that key, so a selection that filtered the overview
correctly matched nothing here whenever the two differ: a silently empty
table, which reads as "no requests" rather than as a bug.

These tests pin the producer, not the ring. The existing ring tests inject
records of their own making, so nothing checked what the proxy actually
writes -- which is how this got shipped.
