routes_engine.py is the pattern the Backend interface was modelled on:
capability-driven, self-explaining, refusing rather than misleading. This route
generalises it from a single driver capability to per-backend capabilities

{"driver":"subprocess","supports_version_select":false,"vllm_version":"0.26.0"}
