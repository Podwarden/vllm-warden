"""The replicated-oracle search (design §3).

Two properties are load-bearing and both were wrong in v1 of the design:

1. Plain bisection is INVALID here. Measured on pw-bonus 2026-09-03: the same
   prompt size crashed once and passed once. A single query at the midpoint is
   wrong half the time in the transition band, the error is irreversible, and
   the algorithm cannot detect it. `PASS_N` fixes this by replicating the
   oracle, converging on a lower, quantifiable failure contour.

2. Bisection needs p(x) monotone in *x*, which is asserted nowhere and argued
   against in three places (sliding-window attention, the 65k->131k VRAM
   plateau, and the open question of whether the crash depends on length at
   all). Phase D exists to catch exactly that.

The oracle is injected, so the whole search is testable against a configurable
p(fail) with no GPU.
