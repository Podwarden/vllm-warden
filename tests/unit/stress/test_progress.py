"""What a run reports about itself while it is still running.

Reported 2026-09-04 with a screenshot: a thorough run in flight showed
"0 probe(s)", "No probes recorded yet", and a progress bar rendered FULL.
Observations are written once, at finish, so for a run that takes hours the
modal had nothing — and a full bar reads as "finished", which is the worst of
the three possible wrong answers.

The ETA is derived from what the phase actually knows: each phase declares how
many steps it plans, and the estimate is that phase's measured pace applied to
its own remainder. It is never extrapolated across phases, because the phases
have wildly different unit costs — a length rung is one HTTP probe, a sweep
candidate is an engine reload that can take ten minutes.
