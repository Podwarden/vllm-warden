"""What context the ENGINE will actually accept (design §6, budget sizing).

Third abort on the same model, 2026-09-04. `models.max_model_len` is NULL for
`gpt-oss-20b-gguf` — nobody set it — so `budget_cap_for` received
`context_window=None`, fell back to BUDGET_FLOOR, and the needle probe hit
exactly 1024 and starved. Meanwhile the engine's own `/props` reported
`n_ctx: 131072`. The harness had 131k available and used 1k.

Note the deliberate contradiction with `ceiling.py`, which REFUSES this same
number. That module answers "how far can this model go?", where the engine's
report is our own `--ctx-size` echoed back and using it would be circular. This
module answers "how many tokens will the engine accept from us right now?",
where that configured value is precisely the authority. One field, two
questions, two different correct answers.
