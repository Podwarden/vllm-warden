"""A cached run only answers a question as demanding as the one it asked.

Reported by the operator, 2026-09-04: "it wont let restart with a longer test".
A `conservative` run had just completed, and asking for a longer mode returned
`200 reused` naming it. The cooldown asked "is there a recent measurement for
this fingerprint?" and never "does that measurement answer THIS request?".

The modes are not interchangeable. `thorough` confirms 7/7 rather than 5/5,
probes three needle offsets rather than one, and is the only mode that runs the
configuration sweep -- so it is the only mode that can produce a
`recommended_config` at all. Handing back a conservative run withholds exactly
what the operator asked for, while reporting success.
