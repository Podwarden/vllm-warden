"""The stress lease (design §5.5).

A stress run deliberately crashes an engine. The watchdog's RestartBudget
allows 3 restarts per 3600s and, on exhaustion, leaves the model dead until a
human intervenes -- so three deliberate crashes would take a production model
down for good. The lease makes the watchdog stand down for one model while its
run owns recovery.

Two things v1 of the design got wrong, both fixed here:

* It guarded `check_once`. But `check_once` only probes rows with
  status == 'loaded' (watchdog.py:761), and a real crash flips the row to
  'failed' FIRST -- so recovery actually runs through `restart_crashed_models`
  (watchdog.py:680), which v1 left unguarded. Both would then call `_restart`,
  which force-unloads unconditionally, and whichever lost the race would
  destroy the other's freshly loaded engine.
* It proposed an expiry of "2x expected runtime" -- a SIX HOUR window on
  thorough, during which a dead runner leaves a production model unsupervised.
  `finally` does not run on SIGKILL.
