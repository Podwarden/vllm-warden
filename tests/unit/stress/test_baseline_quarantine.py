"""A probe that fails at the BASELINE must not judge the ladder (design §4.3).

Found on the second production run, 2026-09-04. With the budget fix in, the
baseline calibrated cleanly on `gpt-oss-20b-gguf` -- real answers from all six
probes, nothing starved -- and the run still confirmed nothing:

    needle   -> pass at 1024, 960, 896, 8192
    summary  -> repeating at EVERY length, the baseline included
    raw_confirmed: 0, first_observed_failure: 1024

The summary probe's `repeating` verdict was a false positive: asked the same
question directly, the model produced two clean sentences and stopped. But the
decisive evidence is structural, not aesthetic -- a gate that reads the same at
896 tokens as at 8192 carries NO information about where the model breaks,
while still vetoing every rung.

gates.py already states the principle for SHORT ("a degenerate baseline means
the reference itself was broken... refuse to judge rather than judge wrongly").
Nothing enforced it for the other gates.
