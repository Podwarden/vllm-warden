"""Resolving the model's own context ceiling (design §6).

Without this the sweep can only ask "is the current setting too ambitious?".
It can never ask "can we go higher?", which is half of the question the whole
feature exists to answer.

The subtlety that makes this non-trivial: what a running engine reports is
what it was CONFIGURED with, not what the model can do. Measured 2026-09-03 on
pw-bonus, llama-server b10731 serving qwen3.8-27b with `--ctx-size 131072`:

    GET /props -> default_generation_settings.n_ctx = 131072

which is our own flag echoed back. Reading that as a ceiling and then
"discovering" we can reach it would be circular -- the sweep would confirm the
setting it started from, every time, and report `limited_by: model_ceiling`.
