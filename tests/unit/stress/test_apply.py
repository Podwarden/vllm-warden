"""Applying a measured setting to the model (design §6.4).

"after we did measurements we need to offer to apply the probed settings and
reload."

Applying is the one action in this feature that CHANGES the model rather than
observing it, so every refusal below exists because applying anyway would put
the model into a state the measurement does not describe.

Note what applying costs, which is why it is offered and never automatic: the
settings patch refuses to touch a loaded model, so this is unload -> persist ->
load. The model stops serving for the length of a load, and the measurement
that justified the change describes the configuration being replaced.
