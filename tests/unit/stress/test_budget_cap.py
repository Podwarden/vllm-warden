"""How far the probe budget may grow, derived from the model (not a constant).

"we should not hardcode anything for the model. our user could try any model
from huggingface and any gpu" (2026-09-04).

The escalation ladder was bounded by BUDGET_CAP = 1024, a constant chosen
because it suited the model in front of us. On `gpt-oss-20b-gguf` the needle
probe reached that ceiling and the run aborted with `aborted_no_baseline`;
raising the constant would have fixed that model and mis-sized every other one.
A model with a 4k context cannot spend 1024 tokens thinking, and a model with
262k can spend far more.

The bound that is actually true for every model: the answer has to fit in the
context alongside the prompt. That is measured per model, per configuration.
