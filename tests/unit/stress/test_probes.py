"""Probe generation and grading (design §4.5, §4.6, §9.2).

Two properties here are not cosmetic and would silently invalidate whole axes
if they regressed:

* **Every prompt carries a unique high-entropy preamble at position 0.** vLLM's
  prefix cache is block-aligned and on by default, so concurrent probes sharing
  a prefix get their KV deduplicated and the measured concurrency comes out far
  above what real traffic ever gets. Without this the concurrency axis measures
  nothing at all.
* **Needles are graded on normalised text.** An exact substring match false-fails
  on hyphenation, spacing or a tokenizer split, and with M/M confirmation a
  single formatting quirk kills the rung and truncates the published limit.
