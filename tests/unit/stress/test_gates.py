"""Quality gates — the stress test's primary oracle.

Design §4.2. A run failed when the model stopped producing usable output, not
(only) when the engine died. Every gate here is a HARD BINARY: a graded
"coherence score" would need a threshold nobody could defend, and general
hallucination is not detectable at all. What is detectable is what actually
happens at context limits — answers get short, get cut off, start looping, or
stop following the instruction.

The gates are pure so the whole oracle is testable without a GPU.
