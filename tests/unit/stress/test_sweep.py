"""Planning the configuration sweep, and choosing the answer (design §6).

This is the part that answers the actual question -- "what should max_model_len
be for this model on this hardware?" -- rather than merely reporting where
things broke.

Two rules run through all of it:

* **Prediction prunes; measurement decides.** fit.py can say a candidate is
  certainly too big for the VRAM present, which is worth knowing because every
  reload costs up to load_timeout_s = 600. It cannot say a candidate will work:
  the measured 65,536 -> 131,072 context raise cost ~0 extra VRAM, so the
  prediction is unreliable in exactly the region that matters. No predicted
  number is ever published.
* **Sweeping is expensive.** Candidates must be few and informative.
