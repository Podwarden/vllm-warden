"""A run that measured nothing must not hold the cooldown (design §7.2).

Found in production 2026-09-04, immediately after the reasoning-budget fix
shipped: the operator pressed "Stress test" twice and both POSTs returned
`200 reused` naming the OLD, valueless run. No new run started, no error
appeared, and the UI reveals its `force` control only on a 409 -- so the
button was inert for the full six-hour cooldown with no way out.

`current_for`'s docstring calls its result "the newest PUBLISHABLE
measurement" and lists four conditions. None of them asks whether the run
published anything. A run that completed having confirmed no value at all --
`recommended_config: None`, `invalid_reason: no_confirmed_value` -- satisfies
all four and blocks re-measurement, which is exactly backwards: a run that
learned nothing is the strongest possible reason to allow another.
