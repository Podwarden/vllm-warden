"""The classifier and accumulator against RECORDED llama.cpp behaviour.

Every payload here was captured verbatim from llama-server b10731 on pw-bonus
on 2026-09-03 (tests/fixtures/stress/llamacpp_recorded.json). That matters:
the synthetic shapes I would otherwise have invented were wrong in two ways
that would have shipped as bugs.

llama.cpp is a first-class backend -- it is serving both models on that host
right now -- so testing only against a vLLM-shaped fake would leave the path
that runs in production unexercised.
