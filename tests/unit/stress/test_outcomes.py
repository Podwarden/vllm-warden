"""Outcome classification (design §5.2, §5.3).

The class that mattered most is REFUSED. v1 of the design confirmed a refusal
by re-probing at 0.9x the failing size — against a GEOMETRIC ladder, where the
first failing rung lies in (R, 2R]. That confirmation succeeds only when
rung <= 1.111R, i.e. log2(1.111) = 15.2% of the interval, so 85% of genuine
engine refusals were misclassified as errors. That is bench-v2's defining
defect reintroduced inside the mechanism advertised as its fix.

v2 replaces it with three non-multiplicative tests: definitional (beyond
max_model_len), last-known-good, and replication.
