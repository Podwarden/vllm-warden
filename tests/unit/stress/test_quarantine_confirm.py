"""A probe is only excluded when it fails the baseline TWICE.

Two runs aborted with `aborted_no_baseline` because both ladder probes were
quarantined. Only `needle` and `summary` judge the ladder, so two failures --
each decided on a SINGLE sample -- end the run, while four other probes may be
answering perfectly.

The design's own argument against single samples applies here more than
anywhere: `search.py` replicates every ladder verdict because one sample near a
threshold is a coin flip, and then the baseline, which shapes the entire run,
was deciding on one. A dropped stream trips ABRUPT via `finish_reason: None` --
a state gates.py calls "real in this codebase" -- and that alone was enough to
retire a probe permanently.

Confirming costs one extra probe per FAILING probe, at the baseline only, which
is the cheapest place in the run.
