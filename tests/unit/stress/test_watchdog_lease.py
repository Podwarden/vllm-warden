"""The lease's integration with the watchdog (design §5.5).

The lease is only worth anything at the point `wants_restart` is consulted,
because that is the single predicate BOTH recovery paths use --
`restore_after_warden_restart` (watchdog.py:666) and `restart_crashed_models`
(watchdog.py:707).

v1 of the design guarded `check_once` instead. That is the path that does NOT
fire on a crash: it only probes rows whose status is 'loaded' (watchdog.py:761),
and a crash flips the row to 'failed' first. So the guard would have sat on the
wrong function while the runner and the sweep both called `_restart` -- which
force-unloads unconditionally (watchdog.py:546) -- and whichever lost the race
would have destroyed the other's freshly loaded engine.

    were "both recovery paths". They are not the path a stress run provokes:
    `check_once` probes rows whose status is still 'loaded' and calls
    `_restart` directly, and a wedged engine under a stress run is exactly
    that -- nothing has set it 'failed', so `wants_restart` is never consulted
    and its lease check never applies.

    deliberately better than none: exercising the real loop needs a supervisor,
    a live port and a health probe. It fails if the guard is removed.
