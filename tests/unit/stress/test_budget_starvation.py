"""Telling "the model failed" apart from "we starved it" (design §4.2).

Found by the first production run, 2026-09-04. `gpt-oss-20b-gguf` on
llama.cpp failed EVERY probe at the baseline condition with
`["abrupt", "reasoning_only", "wrong"]`, and the run correctly published
nothing. The model was healthy the whole time. Measured against the engine on
port 10007, same prompt, only the budget varied:

    max_tokens=16  -> finish_reason=length, content='',   reasoning truncated
    max_tokens=64  -> finish_reason=stop,   content='42', correct
    max_tokens=512 -> finish_reason=stop,   content='42', correct

The suite's graded probes budget 16-32 tokens, which is ~4x the ANSWER and
was sound for a model that answers directly. A reasoning model spends the
whole budget thinking -- 56 completion tokens for `1234 plus 56` -- so
`content` never starts. Every gate then fires truthfully about an artefact of
our own budget.

`models.supports_reasoning` cannot fix this: it is NULL for this very model
(tri-state; the chat-template detection did not fire) and 1 for qwen3.8-27b.
The response itself is the reliable signal, so this is measured, not consulted.
