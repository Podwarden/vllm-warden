"""An unconfigured deployment must accept its own public origin, not localhost.

Behind any reverse proxy — which is how LLM Warden is normally deployed —
`VW_FRONTEND_ORIGIN` is usually unset, because nothing in the deploy flow knows
the public URL at container-build time. `load_settings` then falls back to
`("http://localhost:3000",)`, which is never the browser's origin, so
`require_matching_origin` 403s every request that carries one.

Observed on a live install at https://ultra86.vxloc.com. Login succeeded (it
carries no refresh cookie yet), then every page reload logged the operator out,
because the reload's `POST /api/auth/refresh` was rejected before it could read
the cookie:

    Origin: https://ultra86.vxloc.com  ->  403   origin mismatch
    Origin: http://localhost:3000      ->  401   (reached the handler)

The existing code already knows how to derive the origin from the request, but
only under `trust_proxy_origin`, which defaults False and must be set by hand —
so it does not help the case where nothing was configured at all.

Deriving is safe, and is the same reasoning as PodWarden Core's OIDC redirect
base (core#2599): the browser sets both `Origin` and `Host`, and a page cannot
forge `Host` on a cross-site fetch. Comparing them therefore still answers the
question CSRF protection actually asks — "did this request originate from the
same place it was sent to?" — while a hardcoded localhost answers a question
nobody asked.

The Settings-level fail-closed guarantee is deliberately preserved: constructing
`Settings(allowed_origins=(), derive_origin_from_request=False)` still blocks
everything. Derivation is opt-in state that only `load_settings` turns on, and
only when the operator configured no origin.
