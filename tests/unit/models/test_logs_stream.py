    useEventSource's ticket-mint preflight as a terminal-error and the
    UI stuck on "stream unavailable" even though the subprocess would
    create the file moments later. The route now matches the
    supervisor's O_CREAT | O_APPEND behaviour — the file is touched

    Verified at the handler level (rather than via TestClient) because
    the StreamingResponse is endless from the HTTP transport's view —
    httpx wouldn't see the disconnect until the response is consumed,
    so a TestClient `.get` would block. The file-creation side-effect
    happens synchronously inside the handler before the
    StreamingResponse is returned, so we can assert on it without
