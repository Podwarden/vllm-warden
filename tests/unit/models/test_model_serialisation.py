"""Structural guard against the hand-built-dict drift in the models read path.

The operator-visible symptom was "every model reports Engine: vllm", including
one demonstrably running ``llama-server``. The cause was not a wrong value: it
was that ``GET /api/models/{id}`` built its response as a dict literal, so every
column added by a migration (0027's ``backend``, 0028's ``mmproj_filename`` /
``n_gpu_layers``) had to be remembered at a second site — and was not.

``test_get_model_response_covers_every_model_row_field`` is the test that makes
that class of drift impossible rather than merely fixed: it enumerates
``ModelRow``'s dataclass fields and fails if the detail response cannot account
for one. A future migration that appends a column now fails HERE, at the point
where someone can still decide whether it is public, instead of silently
reaching the UI as ``undefined``.

#237 found the second-order version of the same bug: ``GET /api/models``
(list) hand-maintained its OWN narrower allowlist, so ``max_model_len`` /
``gpu_memory_utilization`` / ``extra_args`` and all three ``supports_*``
capability flags reached detail but not list -- and none of the three
capability flags reached EITHER response, because they were explicitly
withheld on the theory that ``GET /api/models/{id}/settings`` was their only
publish surface. ``test_detail_and_list_agree_field_for_field`` and the
tri-state tests below guard against both regressing.
