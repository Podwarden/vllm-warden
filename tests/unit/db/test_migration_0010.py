"""Verify migration 0010 creates the settings table and seeds 8 defaults.

The ghost `hf_cache_dir` key 0010 used to seed is removed from the seed (and
deleted from existing DBs by 0023) — its DB value was never read; the cache
path is env-driven via `VW_HF_CACHE_DIR` → `settings.hf_cache_dir`.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-vllm-warden-ui-redesign-design.md (Phase 3).

The settings table did not exist in any prior migration — 0010 is the first
to create it. The seed must be idempotent so re-running migrations on an
already-initialized DB is a no-op (INSERT OR IGNORE).
