"""Migration 0021: documents the `public_url` runtime key.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-settings-redesign-design.md (#154).

0021 is intentionally a no-op at the row level — the FE falls back to
`window.location.origin` when the key is absent, so seeding a placeholder
would either be wrong (an arbitrary URL) or noisy (a sentinel the FE then
has to recognise as "treat-as-unset"). What this test pins:

  * The migration runner records 0021 as applied (so future migrations
    don't re-run it).
  * No `public_url` row appears in the settings table (no accidental seed).
  * The settings-table seed from 0010 is untouched.
  * Re-applying migrations is a no-op.
