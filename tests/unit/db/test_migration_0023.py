"""Migration 0023: remove the ghost `hf_cache_dir` setting.

`hf_cache_dir` was seeded by 0010 and exposed as an editable runtime key, but
its DB value was NEVER read — the engine + pull task derive the cache path from
`VW_HF_CACHE_DIR` (env → `settings.hf_cache_dir`), not from this KV row. Editing
it in the UI silently did nothing. 0023 deletes the stray row from existing DBs
(0010's seed line is removed in the same change so fresh DBs never get it).

What this test pins:
  * The migration runner records 0023 as applied.
  * No `hf_cache_dir` row remains after a full migration run.
  * Re-applying migrations is a no-op (delete stays deleted, recorded once).
