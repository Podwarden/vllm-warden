"""Guard: the product's user-visible name is "LLM Warden", never "vLLM Warden".

The product now runs two inference backends (vLLM and llama.cpp), so the
two-word product name was renamed to **LLM Warden**. This is a *display-only*
rename: identity strings are deliberately untouched.

What this guard forbids and what it deliberately does NOT forbid:

* FORBIDDEN — the two-word product name with a whitespace separator, in any
  casing: ``vLLM Warden``, ``vllm warden``, ``VLLM Warden``.
* ALLOWED — the bare engine name ``vLLM``. The product serves vLLM, so
  "vLLM version", "the vLLM engine", "live vLLM logs" and ``vllm/vllm-openai``
  are all *correct* prose that this guard must never break. A test that
  forbade the bare word would block true statements about the engine.
* ALLOWED — the identity slug ``vllm-warden`` / ``vllm_warden`` (image names,
  the Hub catalogue slug and ``app_family``, k8s namespaces, ``/data``
  paths, container names, module paths, repo URLs). Those are a separate,
  breaking piece of work; the hyphen/underscore forms are not matched here.

The separator is the entire discrimination rule: whitespace means somebody
wrote the product's *name*; a hyphen or underscore means an *identifier*.

# This used to carry `SCANNED_FILES = ("README.md",)`, and that tuple went
# stale the moment the README was split by section: five public documents and
# CONTRIBUTING.md appeared, none of them named here, so the majority of the
# public prose had no guard at all and nobody was told. `MANAGED_DOCUMENTS` in
# scripts/sync-shared-docs.py has the same failure mode for the same reason,
# and the catalogue row is the proof it is not theoretical -- its name, its
# About text and the template's `stack_label` all still said "vLLM Warden"
# because no check enumerated them.
#
# So the surfaces are found, not listed: every `.md` at the repository root,
# every `.md` under `documents/` and `.github/` at any depth, plus the code
# and catalogue trees below. A document added next month is guarded the day it
# lands.
#
# A repo-wide walk is still wrong, hence named trees rather than
# `REPO_ROOT.rglob`: the CI runner's build directory keeps untracked
# node_modules and root-owned caches from sibling jobs, and `docs/` is the
# internal tree, whose plans and postmortems are historical records of work
# done under the old name and are left as written.
