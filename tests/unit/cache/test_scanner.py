"""Unit tests for the pure-sync HF cache walker.

The walker is decoupled from FastAPI so these tests just create a few
directories in a tmpdir and assert on the dataclasses that come back —
no app, no DB, no event loop. Every assertion here pins a behaviour
described in the spec § Testing / scanner.
