"""JWT-gate smokes for ``app/chat/routes_api.py``.

Parity with ``tests/unit/cache/test_routes.py`` — every other ``/api/*``
slice carries a unit test that pins the 401 contract on each of its
routes, so a future refactor of the auth dependency wiring (removing
``Depends(require_jwt)`` from a single route, swapping the auth
dependency, etc.) is caught here instead of at integration time.

The S8 playground exposes three endpoints, all behind ``require_jwt``:

* ``POST /api/chat/playground/ensure``  — idempotent token-mint
* ``POST /api/chat/completions``        — SSE proxy
* ``GET  /api/admin/active-requests``   — diagnostic counter

For the POST routes we attach a valid CSRF header — without it the CSRF
middleware short-circuits with a 403 BEFORE the auth dependency runs,
which would mask the gate we actually want to assert. Same pattern
used by ``tests/unit/tokens/test_tokens_api.py::test_create_requires_session``.
