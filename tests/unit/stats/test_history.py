"""Server-side history for the stats page.

Three defects reported by the operator, 2026-09-05, all one architecture:
"after a request ends it seems that all charts and graphs reset". Nothing kept
history server-side, sparklines were ~80 s of client-side React state that
unmounted on navigation, and a completed request was erased from the registry
in the streaming `finally` -- so its duration, TTFT and finish reason were
discarded at the exact moment they became knowable.

Everything here is deliberately free of engine, DB and HTTP imports, so the
retention rules can be tested without any of them.
