"""``GET /api/stats/live`` with more than one engine loaded.

``_loaded_model`` ended in ``LIMIT 1``, so on a box running two engines the live
dashboard reported one of them — and which one was whatever SQLite returned
first, so it was not even a stable answer, let alone a stated one.

Two properties are pinned here and they pull in opposite directions, which is
why both are tested:

  * the frame carries EVERY loaded model, so a client can choose;
  * ``build_frame``'s per-model block is BYTE-IDENTICAL to what it always
    produced, because eleven dashboard panels read it field by field and its
    shape is committed as a golden.
