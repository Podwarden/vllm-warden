"""``GET /api/stats/v2/overview?models=`` — the model selection.

The page listed the loaded models and then showed one combined set of numbers
with no way to ask about one of them. This module pins what a selection means,
per series, because the three data sources carry different dimensions:

  tokens / tps   ``model_samples`` has a model_id, so a selection is an exact
                 partition -- every model selected sums to the unfiltered total.
  vram / util /  no model column anywhere. The selection resolves to the union
  power          of the models' ``gpu_indices``, and the cards are filtered by
                 that: "this model's VRAM" is "the VRAM of the cards it holds".

The tests below are written against a fixture with two models on two separate
cards, which is the operator's actual deployment: llama-3.1-8b on vLLM/GPU 1
and qwen3.8-27b on llama.cpp/GPU 0.
