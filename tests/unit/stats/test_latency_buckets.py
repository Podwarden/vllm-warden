"""Latency as a measured distribution, not five quantiles.

The operator asked for "gaussian diagrams for latency". A gaussian is the wrong
model and the project's own rule forbids it: TTFT here is bimodal by
construction — a prefix-cache hit lands near 0.3 s and a cold prefill near 6 s —
so a fitted curve, or the p50 of 2.2 s that currently sits in the valley
between the two humps, describes a request that never happened.

The raw material was already being thrown away. `Metrics.histogram()` returns
the engine's full cumulative bucket array and `build_frame` reduced it to five
numbers. Emitting the buckets lets the client draw windowed deltas — a real
measured distribution over the last N minutes — with the percentiles as markers
on it rather than as a substitute for it.
