"""The proxy's finished-request write path into the persisted history store.

Reported by the operator, 2026-09-05: "after a request ends it seems that all
charts and graphs reset". The registry holds only in-flight requests and drops
each one in the streaming `finally`, so duration, TTFT and finish reason — the
three things that only become knowable at that instant — were discarded there.
They now go to SQLite through ``app.state.request_history``.

The endpoints that read the store are covered in test_v2_requests.py.
