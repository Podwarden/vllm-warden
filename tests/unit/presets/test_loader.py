"""Tests for ``app.presets.load_presets`` — the JSON loader behind the
built-in preset list shipped with the warden.

These are pure unit tests: no fixtures, no HTTP, no auth. They pin:

* the built-in JSON is well-formed and yields exactly four presets,
* every required field is non-empty on every entry,
* the loader raises ``RuntimeError`` for missing/malformed inputs,
* the ``Preset.to_dict()`` shape matches the API contract.
