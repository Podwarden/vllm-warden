"""HTTP route tests for ``GET /api/presets``.

These tests run against the real FastAPI app and a temp DB seeded the
same way every other ``/api/*`` test does. Auth is JWT-only (no SSE
ticket / CSRF dance required for a GET).

We pin:

* 401 without a Bearer (the auth contract for ``/api/*``),
* 200 with the right shape (`presets: [{id, name, ...}]`),
* the four built-in IDs (so a JSON edit catches mismatch with FE tests),
* every preset's ``settings`` dict is non-empty.
