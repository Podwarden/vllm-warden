# The Python base image is no longer named here: scripts/ci-deps-image.sh owns

# cannot drift apart on it.

# Run a command against the project's Python dependencies.
#
# scripts/ci-deps-image.sh — the same resolver .gitlab-ci.yml uses, so local
# and CI agree by construction — picks the prebuilt dependency image for the
# current requirements.txt/requirements-dev.txt pair if it is present, and
# otherwise falls back to python:3.11-slim + the same `pip install` these
# targets used to run unconditionally. It sets:
#
#   VW_RUN_IMAGE  the image to run
#   VW_PIP        `:` when the deps are baked in, the pip install when not
#
# WHY IT MATTERS LOCALLY: every `make test-unit` / `make lint` / `make
# typecheck` used to reinstall the whole pinned set from PyPI, and failed
# outright whenever PyPI was slow (twice on 2026-09-03). With the image present
# these targets do no network I/O at all.
#
# The resolver does NOT reach for the registry on a workstation unless asked,
# so a machine with no route to registry.podwarden.com falls back instantly
# instead of blocking on a doomed pull. Fetch (or build) the image once with:
#
#   make deps-image
#
# Recipes concatenate onto the trailing open quote, e.g.
#   $(RUN_DEPS)"pytest -v"

# Pull the prebuilt dependency image for the current requirements pair, build
# it locally if the registry does not have it, and push what we built so the
# next machine pulls instead of rebuilding.
#
# Pushing from a workstation is safe because this tag is content-addressed --
# the requirements digest plus the architecture -- so a push is idempotent and
# can only ever add the image someone else would have built identically. It is
# a shared cache, not a release. The push is best-effort: a developer without
# registry write access still gets their local image, and sees a warning
# rather than a failed target.
#
# The arm64 tag exists only because a workstation pushed it. CI runs on amd64
# runners and deliberately does not build arm64 -- that would mean emulating
# the thing this whole arrangement avoids.

	# code, not a body, because the bodies differ across builds (build SHA
	# in /api/csrf, Next chunk hashes in /ui/) and would make this brittle.
	#
	# `-L` follows redirects — `/ui/` 308→`/ui` 307→`/ui/models` 200 is
	# the natural Next.js basePath landing flow; we care that the chain
	# terminates in a 200, not the intermediate hops.
	#
	# Expected (final-status, after redirect chain):
	#   /            → 200 (landing page HTML, public)
	#   /_landing    → 200 (same content, direct)
	#   /ui/         → 200 (Next.js root page, possibly /ui/models or /ui/login)
	#   /api/csrf    → 200 (CSRF bootstrap, no auth required)
	#   /healthz     → 200 (uptime probe — Caddy → Next /healthz alias)

	# `|| rc=$$?` is load-bearing, not defensive clutter. Under `set -e` a bare

	# and make reports a naked `*** [smoke] Error 7`. That says nothing about
	# WHICH url failed or why — which is the one thing a smoke test exists to
	# tell you. Trapping the status keeps the shell alive long enough to say it.
	#
	# The two failure kinds are genuinely different and must not be merged:
	# a non-zero curl exit means the request never completed (wrong port, stack
